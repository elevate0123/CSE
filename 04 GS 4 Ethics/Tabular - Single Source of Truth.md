It must be enlightened by reason and ethical principles.                                               |
| **5.**    | **Empathy** <br>*(High Priority)*  | *"Empathy is seeing with the eyes of another, listening with the ears of another, and feeling with the heart of another."* - Alfred Adler       | Empathy is the capacity to understand or feel what another person is experiencing from within their frame ofreference, i.e., the capacity to place oneself in another's position.                                                         | **Positive:** <br>1.

It ensures that welfare schemes are implemented with a human touch and that the most vulnerable are not left behind.<br>**• Connection:** If **Empathy** is the "diagnosis" of suffering, **Compassion** is the "prescription" to alleviate it.                                                                                                                                 |
| **7.**    | **Tolerance**                      | *"Since I am a human being, I have a right to have rights."* - A quote from the play *Nathan the Wise*, a classic plea for religious tolerance. | Tolerance is the ability or willingness to accept the existence of opinions or behavior that one dislikes or disagrees with, without prejudice. It is a core value for peaceful coexistence in a diverse society.                         | **Positive:** <br>1. The administrative handling of large, peaceful religious gatherings like the **Kumbh Mela**, which requires immense tolerance and management of diverse groups.<br>2.

| **18.** | **Conflict of Interest** <br>*(High Priority)* | *"No man can serve two masters."* - The Bible (Matthew 6:24) | A situation in which a person's private interests—such as financial, professional, or personal relationships—could potentially interfere with or influence their judgment in the performance of their official duties. | **Positive (Handling):** <br>1. A Supreme Court judge **recusing** themselves from a case involving a company in which they hold shares.<br>2. An official disclosing their relationship with a bidder for a government contract and withdrawing from the selection committee.<br>**Negative (Violation):**<br>1. A minister for civil aviation framing policies that benefit an airline owned by their family.<br>2. A doctor in a public hospital referring patients to their private clinic for expensive tests. | A teacher being asked to grade their own child's exam paper, which presents a clear conflict between their professional duty (to be impartial) and their personal role (to be a supportive parent). | **• Types:** <br>**Actual:** A direct conflict exists.<br>**Potential:** A conflict could arise in the future.<br>**Perceived:** Others could reasonably think a conflict exists, even if it doesn't. A public servant must avoid all three.<br>**• Management:** Disclosure, Recusal (withdrawing from the decision), Divestment (selling the conflicting asset), or seeking a third-party evaluation. |
| **19.** | **Citizen's Charter** | *"A Citizen's Charter is a written, voluntary declaration by service providers about their service standards, choice, accessibility, and grievance redressal."* - 2nd ARC | A Citizen's Charter is a document that outlines the commitment of a public service organization towards its citizens. It details the standards of service, information, access, and grievance redressal mechanisms. | **Positive:** <br>1. The **Citizen's Charter of the Department of Posts**, which specifies timelines for money orders and speed post delivery.<br>2. The **Sevottam Model**, a framework proposed by the 2nd ARC to assess and improve the quality of public service delivery, which is an advanced form of a charter.<br>**Negative:**<br>1. Many government websites have charters that are outdated, non-specific, and lack any real enforcement mechanism, making them mere "paper tigers."<br>2. The absence of a penalty clause if the standards mentioned in the charter are not met. | A private courier company's promise of "delivery within 24 hours or your money back," which is a form of service charter. | **• Core Principles:** Quality (improving service quality), Choice (for users), Standards (specifying what to expect), Value (for taxpayers' money), Accountability, and Transparency.<br>**• Challenges in India:** Lack of consultation with stakeholders while drafting, poor awareness among citizens, non-justiciable nature, and resistance from within the bureaucracy.<br>**• Measures to Improve:** Involve citizens in drafting, make them legally enforceable with penalties, and conduct periodic reviews. |
| **20.** | **Code of Ethics vs. Code of Conduct** | *"A Code of Ethics is about 'being good,' while a Code of Conduct is about 'not being bad'."* - A common distinction. | **Code of Ethics:** An aspirational document that outlines the broad moral principles and values that should guide the decisions and behavior of a professional group.<br><br>**Code of Conduct:** A specific, prescriptive set of rules that explicitly states what actions are permitted and prohibited for members of an organization. | **Ethics Example:** The value of **"maintaining political neutrality"** mentioned in the draft Public Service Bill.<br>**Conduct Example:** The rule in the **All India Services (Conduct) Rules, 1968**, prohibiting the acceptance of expensive gifts.<br><br>**Ethics Example:** The Hippocratic Oath for doctors, guiding them to act in the patient's best interest.<br>**Conduct Example:** A hospital rule stating that a doctor cannot perform surgery without the patient's written informed consent. | **Ethics:** A family's unwritten rule to always be honest and supportive of each other.<br><br>**Conduct:** A specific family rule that "all homework must be finished before watching TV." | **• Basis of Distinction:**<br>**Nature:** Ethics is guiding & aspirational; Conduct is specific & regulatory.<br>**Focus:** Ethics focuses on values & judgment; Conduct focuses on behavior & compliance.<br>**Enforceability:** Ethics is morally sanctioned; Conduct is legally enforceable with penalties.<br>**Scope:** Ethics is broad ("Be impartial"); Conduct is narrow ("Do not accept a gift worth more than Rs. 5000").<br>India has a Code of Conduct for civil servants but lacks a legislated Code of Ethics. |

### Section 4: Ethical Theories & Moral Thinkers

This section covers major ethical frameworks and key ideas from influential thinkers, providing the language and logic to justify your ethical stances.

| **S.No.** | **Keyword / Jargon** | **Quote** | **Definition** | **Administrative Application & Example** | **Strengths & Weaknesses** | **Other Details (The Analysis Hub)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **21.** | **Deontology (Duty-Based Ethics)** <br>*(High Priority)* | *"Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law."* - Immanuel Kant | A normative ethical theory that judges the morality of an action based on the action's adherence to a set of rules or duties. It holds that some acts are morally obligatory regardless of their consequences. | **Application:** Justifying adherence to the Rule of Law, Code of Conduct, and Constitutional principles, even if it leads to unpopular or difficult outcomes.<br>**Example:** An officer refusing to bend a rule to grant a tender to an influential but undeserving person, because the *duty* to be impartial is absolute. | **Strengths:** Provides a strong basis for universal moral laws, protects individual rights, and promotes a sense of duty.<br>**Weaknesses:** Can be rigid and inflexible, fails to resolve conflicts between two duties (e.g., duty to tell the truth vs. duty to protect someone from harm), and ignores the consequences of actions. | **• Core Idea:** The *means* (the action itself) are more important than the *ends* (the consequences).<br>**• Key Thinker:** Immanuel Kant.<br>**• Central Concept:** **Categorical Imperative** - A universal moral command that is unconditionally binding on all rational beings. |
| **22.** | **Utilitarianism (Consequentialism)** <br>*(High Priority)* | *"The greatest good for the greatest number."* - Jeremy Bentham | A normative ethical theory that judges the morality of an action based on its consequences. The most ethical choice is the one that will produce the greatest good (utility) for the greatest number of people. | **Application:** Justifying policy decisions that benefit a large section of society, even if it causes inconvenience to a smaller section.<br>**Example:** The construction of a dam that displaces a few villages but provides irrigation and electricity to millions of people downstream. | **Strengths:** Practical, intuitive, and focuses on promoting overall human well-being. It is often the basis for public policy.<br>**Weaknesses:** Can lead to the **"tyranny of the majority,"** where the rights of a minority are sacrificed. It is difficult to measure and compare "happiness" or "utility." It can justify immoral means to achieve a good end. | **• Core Idea:** The *ends* (the consequences) justify the *means*.<br>**• Key Thinkers:** Jeremy Bentham (Act Utilitarianism), John Stuart Mill (Rule Utilitarianism - following rules that generally produce the greatest good). |
| **23.** | **Virtue Ethics** <br>*(High Priority)* | *"We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit."* - Aristotle | A normative ethical theory that emphasizes the virtues, or moral character, of the decision-maker, rather than duties or consequences. It asks, "What would a virtuous person do in this situation?" | **Application:** Justifying decisions based on the development of one's character as an ideal public servant. It is the basis for cultivating values like integrity, compassion, and courage.<br>**Example:** An officer choosing to be empathetic and patient with a citizen not because a rule says so, but because it reflects the *virtue* of a good public servant. | **Strengths:** Focuses on the holistic moral life of a person, not just isolated acts. It is flexible and context-sensitive.<br>**Weaknesses:** Provides less clear guidance on resolving specific ethical dilemmas. There can be disagreement on what constitutes a "virtue." | **• Core Idea:** Focuses on the "agent" (the person acting), not the "act" itself. The goal is to achieve **Eudaimonia** (human flourishing).<br>**• Key Thinker:** Aristotle.<br>**• Central Concept:** **The Golden Mean** - The desirable middle ground between two extremes (e.g., courage is the mean between cowardice and recklessness). |
| **24.** | **Social Contract Theory** | *"Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains."* - Jean-Jacques Rousseau | The view that persons' moral and/or political obligations are dependent upon a contract or agreement among them to form the society in which they live. Citizens give up some individual freedoms in exchange for state protection and social order. | **Application:** Explaining the philosophical basis of a civil servant's authority and duty. The officer's power is derived from this contract, and their duty is to uphold their end of the bargain—providing security, justice, and welfare.<br>**Example:** The state's power to collect taxes is justified by its duty to provide public goods like roads, defense, and healthcare as per the social contract. | **Strengths:** Provides a rational justification for the existence of the state and the Rule of Law. Emphasizes the role of consent and citizen rights.<br>**Weaknesses:** The "contract" is a historical fiction; no one explicitly signs it. It can be interpreted in different ways (e.g., Hobbes vs. Locke vs. Rousseau). | **• Core Idea:** The legitimacy of the state is based on the consent of the governed.<br>**• Key Thinkers:** Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau. |
| **25.** | **Rawls's Theory of Justice (Justice as Fairness)** | *"The principles of justice are chosen behind a veil of ignorance."* - John Rawls | A theory of distributive justice that aims to establish a just and fair society. It proposes two main principles: <br>1. **The Liberty Principle:** Each person has an equal right to the most extensive basic liberties.<br>2. **The Social & Economic Principle:** Inequalities are permissible only if they are (a) to the greatest benefit of the least-advantaged members of society (**The Difference Principle**) and (b) attached to offices and positions open to all under conditions of fair equality of opportunity. | **Application:** The philosophical foundation for India's policy of **reservations** and other affirmative action programs. It justifies unequal treatment to benefit the most disadvantaged sections of society.<br>**Example:** Progressive taxation, where the rich are taxed at a higher rate to fund welfare schemes for the poor, is an application of the Difference Principle. | **Strengths:** Provides a powerful framework for balancing liberty and equality. It gives special protection to the most vulnerable.<br>**Weaknesses:** Can be seen as infringing on individual liberty for the sake of equality. The "Veil of Ignorance" is a hypothetical thought experiment, not a practical tool. | **• Core Idea:** Justice as Fairness.<br>**• Key Thinker:** John Rawls.<br>**• Central Concept:** **Veil of Ignorance** - A thought experiment where you decide principles of justice without knowing your own position in society (class, gender, talent etc.), ensuring impartiality. |
| **26.** | **Gandhian Ethics** | *"The means may be likened to a seed, the end to a tree; and there is just the same inviolable connection between the means and the end as there is between the seed and the tree."* - M.K. Gandhi | A holistic ethical framework based on the principles of **Truth (Satya)** and **Non-violence (Ahimsa)**. It emphasizes the purity of means, selfless service (**Sarvodaya**), trusteeship, and concern for the last person (**Antyodaya**). | **Application:** A comprehensive ethical guide for an administrator in India.<br>**Example:** Using peaceful persuasion and dialogue (**Satyagraha**) to resolve a land acquisition conflict instead of force. Designing policies based on their impact on the poorest (**Gandhiji's Talisman**). Promoting decentralized governance (**Gram Swaraj**). | **Strengths:** Morally profound, contextually relevant to India, and provides a clear guide to action in complex situations.<br**Weaknesses:** Can be seen as idealistic and difficult to apply in the complex realities of modern statecraft and international relations. | **• Core Idea:** The means and ends are inseparable. Truth is the ultimate principle.<br>**• Key Concepts:** **Satya** (Truth), **Ahimsa** (Non-violence), **Sarvodaya** (Welfare of All), **Satyagraha** (Holding onto Truth/Passive Resistance), **Trusteeship** (The wealthy hold their excess wealth in trust for society), **Gram Swaraj** (Village Self-Rule). |
