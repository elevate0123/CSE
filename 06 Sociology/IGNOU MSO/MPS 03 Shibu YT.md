### **1. The Legacy of the Indian National Movement**

The struggle for India's independence was not a sudden event but a culmination of various movements and stages involving different sections of society, from sepoys and peasants to the educated elite.

#### **Early Phases of the National Movement**
*   **The First War of Independence (1857):** Often called the Sepoy Mutiny, the revolt of 1857 is considered the first major organized resistance against British rule. It began in Meerut among Indian troops of the British East India Company and spread to key areas like Delhi, Agra, Kanpur, and Lucknow.
*   **Peasant and Tribal Struggles:** Alongside the mainstream freedom movement, numerous peasant (Kisan) and tribal movements emerged. Unlike political struggles, these were primarily driven by economic grievances against oppressive landlords (Zamindars) and high land revenues imposed by the colonial administration. These movements laid the groundwork for broader resistance.
*   **Rise of Organized Resistance:** Following the 1857 revolt, various organizations began to form. Initially, these were fragmented, with landlords, peasants, and educated elites forming separate groups to voice their demands. Nationalist leaders like Dadabhai Naoroji, M.G. Ranade, and R.C. Dutt started to critically analyze and expose the economic exploitation of India under colonial rule, linking poverty directly to British policies.

#### **The Foundation of the Indian National Congress (INC)**
Founded in 1885, the Indian National Congress became the primary vehicle for the freedom struggle.
*   **Initial Focus:** In its early days, the INC was dominated by educated elites. Their main demand was for greater Indian representation in the civil services and government. The concerns of workers and peasants were often dismissed as local issues.
*   **Methods:** The early Congress leaders adopted a strategy of petitions and appeals to the British government, avoiding direct confrontation or mass agitation.

#### **The Gandhian Era: Mass Mobilization**
The arrival of Mahatma Gandhi transformed the national movement from an elite-driven effort into a mass struggle.
*   **Inclusion of the Common People:** Gandhi was instrumental in bringing peasants, workers, women, and other marginalized sections into the mainstream of the national movement.
*   **Key Early Movements:**
    *   **Champaran Satyagraha:** Gandhi's first major movement in India was in support of indigo planters in Champaran, Bihar, who were being exploited by British landlords.
    *   **Ahmedabad Mill Strike & Kheda Satyagraha:** He led successful movements for mill workers in Ahmedabad and peasants in Kheda, Gujarat, further establishing his leadership and the efficacy of his methods.
*   **Major National Movements:** Gandhi led several nationwide movements that galvanized the entire country, including the Khilafat Movement, Non-Cooperation Movement, Dandi March (Salt Satyagraha), and the Quit India Movement.
*   **Gandhi's Economic and Social Philosophy:**
    *   **Swaraj (Self-Rule):** In 1930, Gandhi outlined his vision of "Swaraj" or complete independence, which included principles like the abolition of the salt tax, reduction of land revenue, and total prohibition.
    *   **Theory of Trusteeship:** He proposed an economic model where the wealthy would act as "trustees" of national wealth, using it for the benefit of the working class. However, this concept largely failed to gain traction.
    *   **Emphasis on Villages and Spinning Wheel (Charkha):** Gandhi was critical of large-scale industrialization and machinery, which he saw as tools of exploitation. He promoted the spinning wheel as a symbol of self-reliance and economic empowerment for rural India.
    *   **Sarvodaya and Antyodaya:** His social vision was based on "Sarvodaya" (welfare of all) and "Antyodaya" (upliftment of the last person).
    *   **Upliftment of Untouchables:** Gandhi worked extensively for the rights of Dalits, whom he called "Harijans" (children of God), and fought against the practice of untouchability.
    *   **Inclusion of Women:** He was the first leader to bring women out of their domestic roles and into the forefront of national politics during the Satyagraha movements.

### **2. The Constitution of India and State Policy**

The framing of the Indian Constitution was a monumental event following independence. It is the supreme law of the land, guiding the nation's governance and principles.

*   **Adoption and Implementation:** The Constitution was adopted on November 26, 1949, and came into effect on January 26, 1950.
*   **Key Features:** It lays down the framework for the government's powers, political structures, laws, and duties. Crucially, it also defines the fundamental rights of citizens and the duties of the state.

#### **Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP)**
The DPSP are guidelines for the state to follow when framing policies and laws. While not legally enforceable in court, they are fundamental to the governance of the country. Key principles include:
*   **Common Good and Dignity:** Ensuring a social order based on justice—social, economic, and political.
*   **Economic Sphere:** Securing the right to an adequate livelihood for all citizens, ensuring equal pay for equal work for both men and women, and preventing the concentration of wealth.
*   **Rights of Workers, Children, and Weaker Sections:** Protecting the health and strength of workers, providing for early childhood care and education for children, and promoting the educational and economic interests of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and other weaker sections.
*   **Agriculture and Environment:** Organizing agriculture and animal husbandry on modern, scientific lines and protecting the environment.

### **3. Phases of Democracy and Development in Independent India**

India's journey of political democracy and economic development can be divided into three distinct phases.

#### **Phase 1: The Nehruvian Era (1947-1967)**
*   **The Nehru-Mahalanobis Strategy:** This was a long-term, futuristic development strategy focused on building a self-sufficient and modern India.
*   **Key Focus Areas:**
    *   **Heavy Industrialization:** Jawaharlal Nehru, a proponent of modernization, emphasized the establishment of large-scale industries to build a strong economic base.
    *   **Agricultural Growth:** Significant investments were made in agriculture, leading to India achieving self-sufficiency in food production for the first time.
*   **Political Landscape:** This era was characterized by the dominance of a single party, the Indian National Congress.

#### **Phase 2: Political Shifts and Economic Challenges (1967-1990)**
*   **Decline of Congress Dominance:** The 1967 elections marked a turning point, with the rise of regional parties based on state, ethnic, and linguistic identities. The political landscape became more fragmented.
*   **Shift from Long-term to Short-term Goals:** Due to political instability and competition, governments began focusing on short-term populist measures to stay in power, moving away from the long-term vision of the Nehruvian era.
*   **Economic Stagnation:** This period was marked by economic challenges, including food shortages and rising inequality, which led to widespread social and political unrest.

#### **Phase 3: Economic Reforms and Globalization (1991-Present)**
*   **The LPG Reforms (1991):** Facing a severe economic crisis, India adopted the policy of Liberalization, Privatization, and Globalization (LPG).
*   **Impact of Reforms:**
    *   **Open Economy:** The Indian economy was opened up to foreign investment and trade. Tax regimes were liberalized, and private industries were encouraged.
    *   **Shift in Economic Strategy:** The focus shifted from a state-controlled economy to a market-driven one.
    *   **Continued Political Fragmentation:** The era of coalition politics continued, reinforcing the focus on short-term political gains.

### **4. Social Inequality: Caste and Class in India**

Social stratification in India is predominantly shaped by the institutions of caste and class.

#### **The Nature of Caste Inequality**
*   **Hierarchical System:** The Hindu caste system is a rigid hierarchical structure based on birth, traditionally divided into four varnas (Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, Shudras) and the "Untouchables" (Dalits) who were outside the varna system.
*   **Division of Labor and Social Restrictions:** It dictates occupation, marriage (endogamy), social interaction, and even dress codes.
*   **Scholarly Perspectives:**
    *   **Louis Dumont:** Argued that the core principle of the caste system is the opposition between "purity and pollution," which governs the hierarchy. He viewed it as a static, unchangeable system.
    *   **Critics of Dumont:** Other scholars have challenged this view, arguing that the caste hierarchy is not fixed but is fluid and context-dependent. They emphasize that power relations, rather than just ritual status, play a crucial role in determining caste dynamics.

#### **The Nature of Class Inequality**
*   **Origins in the Colonial Era:** The modern class structure in India has its roots in the British colonial period. The British created a new middle class by offering government jobs to educated Indians and a working class through the establishment of industries.
*   **Post-Independence Structure:** After independence, these class divisions solidified. Class is primarily determined by economic factors like wealth, education, and occupation.
*   **Rural vs. Urban Class:** The impact of colonialism shaped class structures in both rural and urban India, creating divisions between landlords, peasants, industrial workers, and the professional middle class.

#### **Interrelation of Caste and Class**
*   **Overlapping Hierarchies:** Both caste and class are systems of hierarchy and inequality, but their organizing principles differ.
*   **Key Differences:**
    *   **Mobility:** Class is an open system allowing for social mobility (an individual can change their class through education or wealth), whereas caste is a closed system where status is determined by birth and cannot be changed.
    *   **Rigidity:** Caste imposes strict social restrictions, while class boundaries are more fluid and permeable.
*   **Contemporary Dynamics:** While traditionally upper castes also held higher class positions, modern economic changes have created a more complex relationship. However, caste continues to significantly influence an individual's access to opportunities and resources, often reinforcing class inequalities.

### **5. The Structure of Indian Government**

The Indian government operates through three main branches, ensuring a system of checks and balances.

#### **The Three Branches of Government**
1.  **Legislature (Parliament):** The law-making body.
2.  **Executive:** The body that implements and executes the laws.
3.  **Judiciary:** The body that interprets the laws and administers justice.

#### **The Legislature (Parliament)**
The central legislature, or Parliament, is the supreme legislative body.
*   **Lok Sabha (House of the People):**
    *   Members are directly elected by the people for a five-year term.
    *   It has a maximum strength of 545 members.
    *   Holds primary power in financial matters.
*   **Rajya Sabha (Council of States):**
    *   Members are elected by the state legislative assemblies, representing the interests of the states.
    *   It is a permanent body, with one-third of its 250 members retiring every two years.
    *   Acts as a check on the Lok Sabha and protects the rights of the states.

#### **The Executive**
*   **President:** The constitutional head of the state.
*   **Vice President:** Acts as the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha.
*   **Prime Minister:** The real head of the executive, who is the leader of the majority party in the Lok Sabha.
*   **Council of Ministers:** Appointed to assist the Prime Minister in governing.

#### **The Judiciary**
*   **Supreme Court:** The apex court of the country, responsible for upholding the Constitution.
*   **High Courts:** Operate at the state level.
*   **District and Subordinate Courts:** Function at the local level.

---

### **6. Federalism in India**

Federalism is a system of government where power is divided between a central authority and constituent political units (states).

#### **Features of Federalism**
*   **Dual Government:** A central government and multiple state governments.
*   **Written Constitution:** A supreme, written constitution that defines the powers of both levels of government.
*   **Division of Powers:** Clear separation of powers between the center and the states.
*   **Independent Judiciary:** An impartial judiciary to resolve disputes between the center and states.

#### **Indian Federalism: A "Quasi-Federal" System**
India's system is often described as "quasi-federal" because it has a strong central government, giving it features of both a federal and a unitary system.
*   **Tendency Towards Centralization:** The central government holds more power than the state governments.
*   **Flexible Constitution:** Unlike a rigid federal constitution, the Indian Constitution can be amended, often by the central government.
*   **Article 356:** This controversial article allows the central government to impose President's Rule and take over the administration of a state if it deems that the state government is not functioning according to the Constitution. This provision has often been criticized for its misuse for political purposes.

#### **Unique Features of Indian Federalism**
*   **Unionization and Regionalization:** Balances the need for national unity with the recognition of regional diversity.
*   **Asymmetrical Power Distribution:** Power is not distributed uniformly among all states, with some states having special provisions.
*   **Local Self-Governance:** The 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments introduced a third tier of government at the local level (Panchayats and Municipalities).

---

### **7. Local Self-Government and Decentralization**

The concept of local self-government, championed by Mahatma Gandhi as "Village Republics," was formally institutionalized through constitutional amendments.

#### **The 73rd Constitutional Amendment (1992) - Panchayati Raj**
This amendment established a three-tier system of governance in rural areas:
1.  **Gram Panchayat (Village Level):** The foundation of the system, with the **Gram Sabha** (an assembly of all adult members of the village) as its core.
2.  **Block Panchayat / Panchayat Samiti (Intermediate Level).**
3.  **Zila Parishad (District Level).**

#### **The 74th Constitutional Amendment (1992) - Municipalities**
This amendment established a three-tier system in urban areas:
1.  **Nagar Panchayat:** For transitional areas (from rural to urban).
2.  **Municipal Council:** For smaller urban areas.
3.  **Municipal Corporation:** For larger urban areas.
*   **Ward Meetings:** Similar to the Gram Sabha, ward meetings are held at the local level to ensure citizen participation.

---

### **8. Social Movements in India: Peasant Movements**

Peasant movements have been a significant feature of India's social and political landscape, both before and after independence.

#### **Phases of Peasant Movements**
*   **Colonial India:**
    *   Led by organizations like the All India Kisan Sabha (the peasant wing of the Communist Party).
    *   **Tebhaga Movement (Bengal):** A struggle by sharecroppers demanding a two-thirds share of the produce instead of one-half.
    *   **Telangana Peasant Uprising (Hyderabad):** A militant struggle against the oppressive rule of the Nizam and feudal landlords.
*   **Post-Colonial India:**
    *   Despite independence and land reforms, the problems of peasants persisted.
    *   **Naxalbari Uprising (1967):** A violent peasant uprising in West Bengal led by Charu Majumdar and Kanu Sanyal against landlords and the state's failure to implement land reforms. This movement gave rise to the Naxalite-Maoist insurgency.
*   **Contemporary India (Farmers' Movements):**
    *   Modern movements are often led by richer, more prosperous farmers rather than poor peasants.
    *   **Key Organizations:**
        *   **Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU):** Founded by Chaudhary Charan Singh, influential in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, and Haryana.
        *   **Shetkari Sanghatana:** Led by Sharad Joshi, active in Maharashtra.
    *   These movements typically focus on issues like better prices for agricultural produce, loan waivers, and subsidies.

### **9. The Role of Media in Indian Democracy**

Media is often called the "Fourth Pillar of Democracy" in India due to its crucial role in ensuring government accountability and informing the public.

#### **Key Functions of Media**
*   **Providing Information:** Acts as a bridge between the government and the people, disseminating information about government policies and actions, while also highlighting public grievances.
*   **Acting as a Watchdog:** Scrutinizes the actions of the government and public officials, holding them accountable for their promises and performance.
*   **Facilitating Two-Way Communication:** Ensures a flow of information from the government to the people and from the people back to the government.
*   **Influencing Public Policy:**
    *   **Influencing Policymakers:** By bringing diverse public opinions and expert views to the forefront, the media can influence the policy-making process.
    *   **Pressurizing Policymakers:** By highlighting public demands and the potential consequences of unpopular policies, the media can pressure the government to act in the public interest.

#### **Evolution of Media's Role**
*   **Early Days (Print Media):** The print press played a vital role in the European Enlightenment and the Indian freedom struggle, often acting as an unbiased source of information.
*   **Modern Democracy (Broadcast and Digital Media):** The advent of TV, radio, and the internet expanded the media's reach. However, this era also saw the rise of media bias, with outlets often aligning with specific political parties or corporate interests.
*   **New Media Technologies (Social Media):** The internet and social media have democratized information but have also led to challenges like misinformation and the manipulation of public opinion. Social media has become a powerful tool for political campaigns and social movements (e.g., the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements).

### **10. Identity Politics in India**

India's immense diversity in terms of caste, religion, language, and ethnicity makes identity a central element of its politics.

#### **Managing Diversity: India's Approach**
*   **The "Salad Bowl" Strategy:** Unlike the "melting pot" model where different cultures assimilate into a dominant one, India adopted a "salad bowl" approach. This model allows different cultural and ethnic groups to maintain their unique identities while coexisting as part of a larger nation.
*   **Democracy as a Tool for Conflict Resolution:** The democratic process, through elections and representation, was chosen as the primary mechanism to address conflicts arising from this diversity.

#### **Forms of Identity Politics**
Despite these strategies, identity has become a major basis for political mobilization, often leading to conflict. The main forms of identity politics in India are based on:
1.  **Caste:** Political parties are often formed along caste lines (e.g., BSP for Dalits). Parties also select candidates based on the caste composition of constituencies to appeal to specific vote banks.
2.  **Religion:** Religious identity, particularly the Hindu-Muslim divide, has been a central and often contentious issue in Indian politics since the Partition. The rise of Hindu nationalist parties like the BJP is a prominent example.
3.  **Language:** Linguistic identity was the basis for the reorganization of states after independence. Demands for new states based on language continue to arise.
4.  **Ethnicity (Tribal Identity):** Ethnic and tribal identities have been a powerful force for mobilization, especially in Northeast India, leading to the creation of several new states (e.g., Nagaland, Meghalaya, Mizoram) to protect the unique cultural identities of tribal groups.

### **11. Human Development in India**

Human development is a concept that goes beyond mere economic growth to focus on the overall well-being and capabilities of people.

*   **Concept Origin:** The concept was popularized by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and pioneered by economists Mahbub ul Haq (Pakistan) and Amartya Sen (India).
*   **Core Idea:** The UNDP's 1990 Human Development Report famously stated, "People are the real wealth of a nation." Human development is defined as a process of enlarging people's choices and improving their well-being.

#### **Key Approaches to Human Development**
*   **Income Approach:** Links development directly to a country's income (GDP per capita).
*   **Human Capital Formation Approach:** Focuses on investing in people's education and skills to increase their productivity.
*   **Human Welfare Approach:** Emphasizes providing social welfare and basic services to the poor.
*   **Basic Minimum Needs Approach:** Proposed by the International Labour Organization (ILO), it focuses on providing six basic needs: health, education, food, water, sanitation, and housing.

#### **The Human Development Index (HDI)**
*   **Purpose:** The HDI is a composite index created in 1990 to measure and rank countries' social and economic achievements.
*   **Three Dimensions:**
    1.  **A Long and Healthy Life:** Measured by life expectancy at birth.
    2.  **Knowledge:** Measured by mean years of schooling and expected years of schooling.
    3.  **A Decent Standard of Living:** Measured by Gross National Income (GNI) per capita.
*   **India's Rank (2023):** India ranked 132nd out of 191 countries, indicating that while economic growth has been significant, there are still major challenges in improving the overall quality of life for its citizens. Factors like social inequality, diversity-related conflicts, and environmental issues contribute to this relatively low ranking.

---

### **12. Gender and Development**

The approach to women's role in development has evolved significantly over the decades.

#### **From Women in Development (WID) to Gender and Development (GAD)**
*   **Women in Development (WID) - 1970s:**
    *   **Focus:** Integrating women into existing development processes.
    *   **Problem Identified:** Women's exclusion from economic activities.
    *   **Goal:** More efficient and effective development by utilizing women's productive capabilities.
    *   **Critique:** This approach was criticized for treating women as passive beneficiaries and for not challenging the underlying patriarchal structures that cause gender inequality.
*   **Gender and Development (GAD) - 1980s onwards:**
    *   **Focus:** Examining the social relations between men and women and challenging unequal power dynamics.
    *   **Problem Identified:** Unequal power relations between genders, classes, and races.
    *   **Goal:** Equitable and sustainable development that empowers women and transforms unequal relationships.
    *   **Solution:** Empowering disadvantaged groups and changing the social, economic, and political structures that perpetuate inequality. This approach recognizes that development affects men and women differently and seeks to address the root causes of gender discrimination.

---

### **13. Regionalism in India**

Regionalism refers to a political ideology focused on the interests of a specific geographical region, often marked by a common language, culture, or ethnicity.

#### **Characteristics of Regionalism**
*   **Psychological Phenomenon:** Based on a sense of shared identity and attachment to a particular region.
*   **Group Identity:** Fosters a strong group identity among the inhabitants of a region.
*   **Focus on Self-Interest:** Prioritizes the development and interests of its own region, often at the expense of national unity or the interests of other regions.

#### **Development of Regionalism in India**
*   **Colonial Era:** British policies of "divide and rule" and uneven economic development created regional imbalances and fostered a sense of separate identity among different regions.
*   **Southern India (Dravidian Movement):** A powerful movement based on linguistic (Dravidian languages) and anti-Brahminical sentiments, which led to the formation of Tamil Nadu.
*   **State Reorganization:** The promise by the Congress party to create states based on language led to widespread demands for linguistic states after independence, culminating in the States Reorganisation Act of 1956.
*   **Northeast India:** Ethnic and tribal identities have driven numerous movements for separate states and autonomy, leading to the creation of states like Nagaland, Meghalaya, and Mizoram.
*   **21st Century:** Demands for new states continue, leading to the formation of Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand (in 2000), and Telangana (in 2014).

#### **Types of Regional Movements**
*   **Secessionism:** Demands for complete separation from India to form an independent country (e.g., some movements in Nagaland and Jammu & Kashmir).
*   **Separatism:** Demands for a separate state within the Indian Union (e.g., the movements that led to the creation of Telangana).
*   **Demand for Full Statehood:** Demands by Union Territories to be granted the status of a full-fledged state (e.g., the ongoing demand by Delhi).
*   **Demand for Autonomy:** Demands by states for greater autonomy from the central government's control.

#### **Impacts of Regionalism**
*   **Positive:** Can promote local development, foster a sense of pride, and encourage cooperative federalism.
*   **Negative:** Threatens national unity, promotes vote-bank politics, weakens the concept of "unity in diversity," and can lead to inter-regional conflicts.

### **14. Internal Migration in India**

Internal migration—the movement of people within a country's borders—is a key driver of development and social change in India.

#### **Types of Internal Migration**
1.  **Rural-to-Rural:** Often dominated by women migrating for marriage.
2.  **Rural-to-Urban:** The most significant stream, driven primarily by economic opportunities.
3.  **Urban-to-Rural:** A smaller stream, often involving people returning to their villages after retirement.
4.  **Urban-to-Urban:** Movement from smaller towns to larger cities for better professional opportunities.

#### **Causes of Internal Migration**
*   **Economic Opportunities:** The primary driver is the search for better jobs and higher wages in urban areas.
*   **Educational Opportunities:** Access to better quality schools and universities in cities.
*   **Availability of Amenities:** Better infrastructure, healthcare, and public services in urban centers.
*   **Family and Social Networks:** The presence of relatives and friends in cities reduces the risks associated with migration.
*   **Push Factors:** Factors like violence, natural disasters, and lack of opportunities in rural areas push people to migrate.

#### **Consequences of Rural-to-Urban Migration**
*   **Economic Growth:** Migration contributes to economic growth by providing labor for urban industries. Remittances sent by migrants to their villages also help reduce rural poverty.
*   **Over-urbanization:** Leads to overcrowding in cities, straining infrastructure and services, and causing the growth of slums.
*   **Rural Decline ("Brain Drain"):** The migration of skilled and educated individuals from villages to cities can hinder rural development.
*   **Economic Inequality:** Can widen the economic gap between urban and rural areas.

---

### **15. Sustainable Development**

Sustainable development is a model of development that seeks to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.

*   **Origin:** The concept gained prominence with the **Brundtland Commission's 1987 report, "Our Common Future."**
*   **Core Principles:**
    *   **Inter-generational Equity:** Ensuring that future generations have access to the same resources and opportunities as the present generation.
    *   **Conservation of Natural Resources:** Using natural resources judiciously to prevent their depletion.
    *   **Environmental Protection:** Integrating environmental protection into the development process.
*   **Three Pillars:**
    1.  **Ecological Sustainability:** Protecting the environment and ecosystems.
    2.  **Social Sustainability:** Ensuring social equity, justice, and well-being for all.
    3.  **Economic Sustainability:** Promoting economic growth that is inclusive and environmentally sound.

#### **Divergent Views on Sustainable Development**
A major debate exists between developed and developing nations regarding the responsibility for environmental degradation.
*   **Perspective of the Developed World:** Often blames the population growth in developing countries for environmental problems.
*   **Perspective of the Developing World:** Argues that the historical and ongoing high consumption patterns and industrial pollution of the developed world are the primary causes of the environmental crisis.

### **16. Assessment of Democracy and Development in India**

There are two main contrasting models used to assess the success of democracy in India.

#### **1. Procedural Democracy**
*   **Focus:** Emphasizes the formal procedures and institutions of democracy, such as regular, free, and fair elections, universal adult franchise, and the existence of political parties and a constitution.
*   **Assessment of India:** From this perspective, Indian democracy is largely considered a success. Elections are held regularly, there is high voter participation, and power has been transferred peacefully between competing parties.
*   **Limitations:** This model is criticized for ignoring the actual outcomes of the democratic process.

#### **2. Substantive Democracy**
*   **Focus:** Goes beyond procedures to assess the quality and outcomes of democracy. It examines whether democracy leads to social and economic equality, justice, and the well-being of all citizens.
*   **Assessment of India:** From this viewpoint, Indian democracy is seen as a failure or, at best, a limited success. Despite formal democratic institutions, deep-seated inequalities based on caste, class, religion, and gender persist. Poverty, lack of access to basic services, and social discrimination remain major challenges.
*   **Efforts Towards Substantive Democracy:** The 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments, which established local self-government, are seen as significant steps toward making Indian democracy more substantive and participatory by empowering marginalized groups and decentralizing power. However, challenges in their implementation remain.
