### **Assessment and Examination Pattern**

The evaluation scheme for MSO-02 is consistent with other MSO courses:

*   **Assignments (Tutor Marked Assignments - TMA):** Carries a weightage of **30%**. You are required to submit one assignment for this course.
*   **Term-End Examination (TEE):** The final written examination accounts for the remaining **70%** of your grade.

**Typical TEE Question Paper Format:**

*   **Duration:** 3 Hours
*   **Maximum Marks:** 100
*   **Structure:** The paper is divided into two sections. You must answer **five questions** in total, ensuring you select **at least two questions from each section**.
*   **Word Limit:** Each answer should be approximately **500 words** long.
*   **Marks per Question:** Each question is worth **20 marks**.

### **Tips for Studying MSO-02**

1.  **Understand the Core Dichotomy:** The entire course revolves around the distinction between **Quantitative** and **Qualitative** research. Make sure you understand their philosophical bases (Positivism vs. Interpretivism), their methods (Surveys vs. Ethnography), their data types (Numbers vs. Words/Images), and their goals (Generalisation vs. In-depth understanding). This is a very common exam topic.
2.  **Master the Terminology:** This course is heavy on specific terminology. Create a glossary for terms like *epistemology, ontology, positivism, hermeneutics, validity, reliability, reflexivity, triangulation, sampling frame, hypothesis,* etc. Using these terms correctly is key to scoring well.
3.  **Think Like a Researcher:** As you study each method, imagine you are designing a research project. Ask yourself: What is my research question? Would a survey or a case study be better? Who would I interview (my sample)? What questions would I ask? This practical approach makes the concepts easier to grasp.
4.  **Connect Philosophy to Practice:** Don't treat Block 1 (Logic of Inquiry) as separate from the rest. Understand how a researcher's philosophical stance (e.g., being a positivist or a feminist) influences their choice of methods and interpretation of data.
5.  **Don't Neglect the Final Steps:** Units on data analysis and report writing (Blocks 6 and 7) are very important and frequently appear in exams. Pay attention to the structure of a research report and the ethics of research.
6.  **Practice with Previous Papers:** Solving past exam papers will help you understand which topics are most frequently asked (e.g., "Compare and contrast quantitative and qualitative research," "Discuss the significance of objectivity in social research," "Explain different types of sampling").
