#### **Tier 1: Absolute Core Topics**

**1. Core Theories of Development**
*   **Modernization Theory (Rostow):**
    *   **Idea:** Linear path from "traditional" to "modern" (Western) society.
    *   **Cause of Underdevelopment:** Internal cultural/social barriers.
    *   **Critique:** Ethnocentric; ignores colonialism.
*   **Dependency Theory (A.G. Frank):**
    *   **Idea:** The "Core" (West) actively **underdevelops** the "Periphery" (Third World).
    *   **Cause of Underdevelopment:** External exploitation through unequal exchange.
*   **Marxian Theory:**
    *   **Idea:** Development occurs through revolutionary stages (**Modes of Production**).
    *   **Engine of Change:** Class struggle driven by internal contradictions.

**2. The "Alternative Trinity"**
*   **Sustainable Development (Brundtland Commission):**
    *   **Definition:** "Meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs."
    *   **Core Principles:** **Inter-generational** and **Intra-generational** equity.
*   **Human Development (Sen, Haq):**
    *   **Idea:** Development is not GNP growth, but the expansion of human **capabilities** (freedoms).
    *   **Measure:** **Human Development Index (HDI)** - combines health, education, and income.
*   **Gandhian Development:**
    *   **Idea:** An ethical, decentralized, and self-reliant alternative to Western materialism.
    *   **Key Concepts:** **Sarvodaya** (welfare of all), **Gram Swaraj** (village self-sufficiency), **Swadeshi** (localism).

**3. Gender and Development (WID, WAD, GAD)**
*   **WID (Women in Development):**
    *   **Problem:** Women are **excluded**.
    *   **Solution:** **Integrate** them into the current system.
*   **WAD (Women and Development):**
    *   **Problem:** The **global capitalist system** is exploitative.
    *   **Solution:** Women must join the class struggle.
*   **GAD (Gender and Development):**
    *   **Problem:** Unequal **gender power relations** (Patriarchy).
    *   **Solution:** **Empower** women and **transform** gender relations through **gender mainstreaming**.

**4. Globalization & Development**

**5. Large Dams & Displacement**
*   **The Debate:** "Temples of Modernity" (State's view) vs. "Temples of Doom" (Movement's view).
*   **Pro-Dam Argument:** National interest (irrigation, hydropower).
*   **Anti-Dam Argument:** **Development-induced displacement**, environmental destruction, failed rehabilitation.
*   **Classic Example:** **Narmada Bachao Andolan (NBA)**.

**6. Civil Society & Social Movements**
*   **Dual Role in Development:**
    1.  **As a CRITIQUE:** Acts as a watchdog, challenges top-down models (e.g., **MKSS** and the **RTI Act**).
    2.  **As an AGENT:** Promotes participatory development, empowers the marginalized (e.g., **Self-Help Groups**).
*   **Environmental Movements:** **Greenpeace** (global advocacy), **Chipko** (local, eco-feminist).

**7. Knowledge & Development**
*   **Knowledge Society:** An economy driven by information and knowledge.
*   **Digital Divide:** The gap in access to ICTs, creating new inequalities.
*   **Indigenous Knowledge (IK):** Local, traditional knowledge systems.

*   **TRIPS:** The WTO agreement criticized for facilitating bio-piracy.

**8. Liberal Perspective on Development**
*   **Core Idea (Adam Smith):** The **free market** ("invisible hand") is the most efficient path to development.
*   **Role of State:** Minimal (**Laissez-faire**).
*   **Development = Economic Growth** (benefits will "trickle down").
*   **Neoliberalism:** The modern resurgence of these ideas (Privatization, Deregulation, Liberalization).
