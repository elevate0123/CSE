### **MSO-004: Quick Revision Notes (Final)**

#### **Tier 1: Absolute Core Topics**

**1. Emergence of Sociology in India & Approaches**
*   **Colonial Roots:** Sociology began with the administrative needs of the British (**Census**) and the textual studies of **Orientalists**.
*   **Book View vs. Field View:** The central methodological debate.
    *   **Book View (Indology):** Understand India via ancient texts (Ghurye). **Critique:** Static, Brahminical.
    *   **Field View (Fieldwork):** Understand India via village studies (Srinivas). **Critique:** Can be a-historical.
*   **Post-Independence:** Shift to **Village Studies** as the core focus.

**2. Caste: Perspectives & Dynamics**
*   **Ghurye:** Defined caste by 6 features, especially **endogamy** and **hierarchy**.
*   **Dumont (*Homo Hierarchicus*):** The core principle is the opposition of **Purity vs. Impurity**. Argued for the separation of ritual **status** (Brahmin) and temporal **power** (Kshatriya).
*   **Ambedkar:** Caste is **institutionalized inequality**. Maintained by **"Graded Hierarchy"** which prevents unity of the oppressed. The key is **endogamy**. Solution is **Annihilation of Caste**.
*   **Srinivas:** Caste is dynamic, not static.
    *   **Sanskritization:** A process of cultural mobility for lower castes.
    *   **Dominant Caste:** A caste with numerical strength and land ownership that holds secular power.
*   **Colonial Census:** Did not create caste, but **objectified** and **politicized** it, making identities more rigid.

**3. Tribal Society: The Core Debate**
*   **The Ghurye-Elwin Debate:**
    *   **Ghurye (Assimilation):** Tribes are **"Backward Hindus."** They should be integrated into the mainstream.
    *   **Elwin (Isolation):** Mainstream contact is exploitative. Tribes need temporary protection in **"National Parks."**
*   **Nehru's "Panchsheel":** The middle path of **integration with protection**.
*   **The 'Commons':** Community-owned resources (forests, pastures) vital for tribal livelihood and culture. Threatened by state appropriation and development projects. **Forest Rights Act (2006)** is a key response.

**4. Agrarian Structure & Change**
*   **Traditional Structure:** Intertwined **caste and land control**. **Jajmani system** of patron-client exchange.
*   **Post-Independence Changes:**
    *   **Land Reforms:** Zamindari abolition was successful; land ceilings largely failed.
    *   **Green Revolution:** Shift to **capitalist farming**. Created a powerful **"rich farmer" class** and increased the number of landless laborers. Led to regional disparities.

**5. Social Movements: Old vs. New**
*   **Old Social Movements (OSMs):**
    *   **Focus:** **Class** and economic exploitation (land, wages).
    *   **Actors:** Peasants, workers.
    *   **Example:** Telangana peasant revolt.
*   **New Social Movements (NSMs):**
    *   **Focus:** **Identity**, environment, gender, human rights.
    *   **Actors:** Students, women, Dalits, Adivasis.
    *   **Example:** Chipko Movement, Narmada Bachao Andolan, LGBTQ+ Movement.
*   **Indian Context:** The line between old and new is often blurred.

#### **Tier 2: High-Probability Topics**

**6. Globalization & its Impact**
*   **Economic:** High growth but also **rising inequality**.
*   **Cultural:** The debate between **Homogenization** (Westernization) and **Hybridization/Glocalization** (blending global with local).

**7. Urbanization & Migration**
*   **Urbanization:** Rapid and "top-heavy" (focused on big cities). Leads to weakening of caste/joint family, but also problems of **slums, pollution, and a vast informal sector**.
*   **Migration:** Driven by rural **"push" factors** (agrarian distress) and urban **"pull" factors"** (employment). Often **circular**.

**8. Indian Secularism**
*   **Western Model:** A strict **"wall of separation"** between state and religion.
*   **Indian Model:** Not separation, but **"principled distance."** The state can intervene in religion for social reform (e.g., abolishing untouchability). Based on **"Sarva Dharma Samabhava"** (equal respect for all religions).

**Final Tip:** Your answers for this paper *must* be grounded in the Indian context. Use the names of Indian sociologists (Ghurye, Srinivas, Ambedkar, Beteille, Dumont) and specific Indian examples (Narmada, Chipko, Green Revolution in Punjab) to make your points. This demonstrates mastery of the subject. Best of luck
