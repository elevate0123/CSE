### **MSO-001: Quick Revision Notes (Final)**

#### **Tier 1: Absolute Core Topics**

**1. Power: The Debates**
*   **Weber:** Power is multi-dimensional: **Class** (economic/market), **Status** (social honor/prestige), **Party** (political).
*   **Marx:** Power is rooted in **economic structure**; held by the class that owns the means of production (bourgeoisie).
*   **Foucault:** Power is not possessed, it's **exercised**. It's diffuse, productive, and linked to **knowledge**.
*   **Community Power (Miller vs. Dahl):**
    *   **Miller (Elitist):** Power is held by a small, reputed elite.
    *   **Dahl (Pluralist):** Power is dispersed among competing groups, visible in decision-making.

**2. Social Structure: The Perspectives**
*   **Radcliffe-Brown (Functionalist):** Structure is an **observable reality**‚Äîthe network of actual social relations.
*   **Levi-Strauss (Structuralist):** Structure is an **unconscious mental model** based on binary oppositions.
*   **Evans-Pritchard:** Structure is the **relation between social groups** (e.g., lineages in The Nuer).

**3. Civil Society & Democracy**
*   **Definition:** The "third sector" of voluntary associations between state and market.
*   **Positive Role:** Acts as a **watchdog** on the state, promotes participation, builds **social capital** (Putnam).
*   **Negative Role:** Can be "uncivil" (extremist groups), reinforcing elite dominance.
*   **Indian Example:** Anna Hazare Movement (watchdog), Narmada Bachao Andolan (participation).

**4. Marx: Core Concepts**
*   **Alienation:** Dehumanization under capitalism. Caused by private property.
    *   **4 Types:** From **Product**, **Process**, **Species-Being** (human essence), and **Others**.
*   **Class Conflict:** The engine of history.
    *   **Class-in-itself:** Objective economic position.
    *   **Class-for-itself:** Subjective class consciousness, ready for revolution.

**5. Weber: Core Concepts**
*   **Legitimacy & Authority:** Authority is legitimate power.
    *   **3 Types:**
        1.  **Traditional:** Based on custom ("always been this way").
        2.  **Charismatic:** Based on a leader's exceptional qualities.
        3.  **Legal-Rational:** Based on impersonal rules (bureaucracy).
*   **Routinization of Charisma:** The process of turning unstable charisma into a permanent traditional or bureaucratic form.

**6. Functionalism & Neo-Functionalism**
*   **Functionalism (Parsons, Merton):** Society is a system of interrelated parts, each with a function to maintain social **equilibrium**.
    *   **Parsons' AGIL:** Adaptation, Goal-Attainment, Integration, Latency.
    *   **Merton's Concepts:** Manifest/Latent functions, Dysfunction.
*   **Neo-Functionalism (Alexander):** A self-critical revision. Acknowledges **conflict**, incorporates **agency**, and focuses on **change**.

#### **Tier 2: High-Probability Topics**

**7. Emergence of Sociology**
*   **Enlightenment:** Provided the belief in **science and reason**.
*   **Counter-Enlightenment:** Provided the core problem: **social order**.
*   **Synthesis (Comte, Durkheim):** Used the scientific method to study the problem of social order.

**8. Stratification: Functionalist Debate**
*   **Davis-Moore Thesis:** Inequality is **functionally necessary** to motivate the most talented people to fill the most important positions.
*   **Tumin's Critique:** Stratification is **dysfunctional**. It restricts the discovery of talent and is based on power, not importance.

**9. Modernity (Giddens)**
*   **Metaphor:** A **"Juggernaut"**‚Äîa runaway engine.
*   **Dynamics:**
    1.  **Time-Space Separation.**
    2.  **Disembedding Mechanisms** (Money, Expert Systems).
    3.  **Reflexivity** (constant questioning of tradition).
*   **Consequence:** We live in a world of **manufactured risk** (e.g., climate change).

**10. Ethnicity (Barth)**
*   **Core Idea:** The focus is not on "cultural stuff" but on the **social boundary** between "us" and "them."
*   **Boundary Maintenance:** Identity is constructed and maintained through social interaction.

**11. Sovereignty**
*   **Definition:** Supreme authority over a territory.
*   **Two Dimensions:** **Internal** (within the state) and **External** (independence from other states).
*   **Challenge:** **Globalization** is eroding absolute sovereignty.

**12. Parsons' Social Action Theory**
*   **Unit Act:** The basic unit of study (Actor, End, Situation, Norms).
*   **Voluntaristic Theory:** Action involves choice, but it is guided and constrained by **social norms**.
*   **Pattern Variables:** The five dilemmas of choice that structure social roles (e.g., Universalism vs. Particularism).
