| Indology (G.S. Ghurye)                                     | `Textual View`, `Brahmanical Perspective`, `Cultural Essence`, `Civilizational Continuity`                                                                                                           | Current political discourses emphasizing ancient texts (e.g., Vedas, Epics) as the sole authentic source of Indian culture and identity.                                                                   | **G.S. Ghurye:** Emphasized understanding Indian society through its ancient scriptures, seeing caste as central to its "Hindu" civilizational core.                                     | **Edward Said:** (Orientalism - as a critique) His work critiques how Western textual interpretations constructed a biased "Orient," relevant to assessing Indological biases.                  |
| Structural Functionalism (M. N. Srinivas)                  | `Field View`, `Empirical Tradition`, `Sanskritization`, `Dominant Caste Politics`                                                                                                                    | Ongoing studies analyzing how "dominant castes" (e.g., Marathas, Jats, Vokkaligas) influence contemporary state-level electoral politics and resource distribution.                                        | **M.N. Srinivas:** Focused on empirical, village-level studies; concepts like Sanskritization show internal dynamics and aspirations within the caste hierarchy.                         | **A.R. Radcliffe-Brown:** His concept of `social structure` as an observable network of social relations directly influenced Srinivas's empirical field approach.                               |
| Marxist Sociology (A. R. Desai)                            | `Historical Materialism`, `Mode of Production Debate`, `State-Capital Nexus`, `Class-based Exploitation`                                                                                             | Marxist analyses of the 2020-21 farmers' protests as resistance against increasing corporatization of agriculture and its impact on peasant classes.                                                       | **A.R. Desai:** Applied Marxist framework to analyze the Indian state as serving bourgeois interests, even in its post-colonial welfare phase.                                           | **Nicos Poulantzas:** His theories on the `relative autonomy of the state` (while ultimately serving capital) offer a nuanced Marxist view applicable to Desai's state analysis.                |
| **2. Impact of colonial rule on Indian society:**          |                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Social background of Indian nationalism                    | `Colonial Modernity`, `Print Capitalism`, `Anti-Colonial Consciousness`, `Subaltern Nationalism`                                                                                                     | Contemporary debates on rewriting history textbooks to reflect diverse, including subaltern, narratives of the freedom struggle beyond elite leadership.                                                   | **Partha Chatterjee:** Analyzed Indian nationalism as having an "inner" (cultural) and "outer" (political) domain, a derivative discourse yet distinct.                                  | **Benedict Anderson:** His `Imagined Communities` concept (nations formed via shared experiences like print media) helps understand how nationalist sentiment spread in colonial India.         |
| Modernization of Indian tradition                          | `Selective Modernization`, `Cultural Syncretism`, `Dialectic of Tradition-Modernity`, `Legal Reforms`                                                                                                | Supreme Court judgments like the Sabarimala temple entry case (2018), attempting to balance traditional religious practices with modern constitutional rights of equality.                                 | **Yogendra Singh:** Analyzed modernization in India as a complex process involving adaptation and reinterpretation of tradition, not just Westernization.                                | **Anthony Giddens:** His concept of `reflexivity` in late modernity, where traditions are examined and reformed rather than blindly followed, applies here.                                     |
| Protests and movements during colonial period              | `Subaltern Resistance`, `Peasant Uprisings`, `Tribal Insurgencies`, `Anti-Imperialist Struggles`                                                                                                     | Commemorations and academic reinterpretations of movements like the Mappila Rebellion (1921) or Birsa Munda's Ulgulan, highlighting their anti-colonial and anti-feudal character.                         | **Ranajit Guha:** Pioneered `Subaltern Studies`, focusing on the agency and consciousness of non-elite groups in colonial India's historical movements.                                  | **E.P. Thompson:** His "history from below" approach (The Making of the English Working Class) resonates with Subaltern Studies' focus on non-elite agency.                                     |
| Social reforms                                             | `Social Reformism`, `Rationalization of Customs`, `Gender Justice Movements (historical)`, `Legislative Intervention`                                                                                | Ongoing debates about enacting a Uniform Civil Code (UCC) as a modernizing social reform, echoing colonial-era debates on reforming personal laws.                                                         | **Uma Chakravarti:** Critically examined 19th-century social reforms, highlighting their patriarchal underpinnings even while addressing issues like Sati or widow remarriage.           | **J.S. Mill:** (On the Subjection of Women) His arguments for women's rights and reform of discriminatory laws influenced many Indian reformers.                                                |
| **B. SOCIAL STRUCTURE**                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| G. S. Ghurye (Perspective)                                 | `Segmental Division`, `Hierarchy`, `Purity-Pollution Ideology`, `Endogamy`                                                                                                                           | Persistence of high rates of caste endogamy as revealed by recent NFHS data (e.g., NFHS-5, 2019-21), reinforcing segmental divisions.                                                                      | **G.S. Ghurye:** Defined caste through its core features, emphasizing its pan-Indian hierarchical structure rooted in purity-pollution.                                                  | **Émile Durkheim:** His concept of `sacred and profane` can be seen as a parallel to Ghurye's emphasis on the purity-pollution dichotomy in caste.                                              |
| M. N. Srinivas (Perspective)                               | `Dominant Caste`, `Sanskritization`, `Westernization`, `Competitive Mobilization`                                                                                                                    | Recent demands for reservation by numerically strong and landed "dominant castes" like Marathas (Maharashtra) or Patidars (Gujarat), citing socio-economic challenges.                                     | **M.N. Srinivas:** Introduced dynamic concepts like Sanskritization and Dominant Caste to show mobility and power shifts within the caste system.                                        | **Robert Merton:** His `reference group theory` (individuals orienting to groups they aspire to join) is analogous to Sanskritization.                                                          |
