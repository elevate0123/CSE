tags: #UPSC #Sociology #KarlMarx #Paper1

[Marx's Sociological Thought]

  [Marx's Materialist Conception of History]
    -> [Historical Materialism is the core framework]
    + [History is a series of class struggles based on economic contradictions]
    + [Economic base (infrastructure) determines the superstructure (law, politics, religion)]
    + [Dialectical materialism drives social change]

  [Mode of Production and Class Conflict]
    -> [Each mode of production has its own class relations]
    + [Feudalism → Bourgeoisie revolution → Capitalism]
    + [Capitalism creates two major classes: Bourgeoisie and Proletariat]
    + [Contradictions in capitalism will lead to its downfall]

  [Surplus Value and Exploitation]
    -> [Labour power creates value]
    + [Capitalists appropriate surplus value generated by workers]
    + [This exploitation is systemic, not moral]
    + [Surplus value is the source of capitalist profit]

  [Alienation of Labour]
    -> [Workers are alienated under capitalism]
    + [From the product of their labour]
    + [From the act of production]
    + [From their own human potential (species-being)]
    + [From fellow workers]

  [Revolution and Class Consciousness]
    -> [Proletariat will develop class consciousness]
    + [From "class in itself" to "class for itself"]
    + [Revolution becomes inevitable due to intensifying contradictions]
    + [Revolution will lead to socialism → communism]

  [Critique of Capitalism]
    -> [Capitalism is unstable and self-destructive]
    + [Tendency for falling rate of profit]
    + [Periodic crises due to overproduction]
    + [Commodification of all aspects of life]

  [Ideology and False Consciousness]
    -> [Ruling ideas are the ideas of the ruling class]
    + [Ideology maintains the status quo]
    + [Religion, law, education serve capitalist interests]
    + [False consciousness prevents workers from recognizing exploitation]

  [Legacy and Contemporary Relevance]
    -> [Influenced Neo-Marxism, Conflict theory, World Systems theory]
    + [Critical theory (Frankfurt School)]
    + [Relevance in analyzing globalization, labour commodification, inequality]
    + [Criticisms: Economic determinism, neglect of agency, failure of predicted revolutions]

[Counter-Arguments / Criticisms]
  - [Overemphasis on economy at the cost of culture and ideas] (e.g., Max Weber)
  - [Revolutions did not occur in advanced capitalist societies]
  - [Emergence of middle classes contradicts binary class theory]
  - [Capitalism has shown adaptability and resilience]
  - [Neglect of gender, race, and other dimensions of inequality]

[Integrations and Syntheses]
  -> [Neo-Marxism addresses cultural and ideological aspects]
  -> [Gramsci's concept of hegemony revises superstructure’s role]
  -> [Weberian Marxism adds legitimacy, status groups]
  -> [Contemporary sociology combines structure and agency]


```argdown

[The material base determines the social superstructure]
  -> [History progresses through dialectical materialism and class struggle]
  -> [Capitalism is inherently exploitative due to surplus value extraction]
  -> [Alienation is a key consequence of capitalist production]
  -> [Class consciousness will lead to proletarian revolution]
  -> [A classless communist society will emerge]

[Capitalism is inherently exploitative due to surplus value extraction]
  -> [Bourgeoisie control means of production and dominate the proletariat]
  -> [Proletariat is alienated from product, process, self, and others]

[Alienation is a key consequence of capitalist production]
  -> [Proletariat is alienated from product, process, self, and others]

[Proletariat is alienated from product, process, self, and others]
  -> [Class consciousness will lead to proletarian revolution]

[Marx’s ideas are foundational to conflict theory in sociology]
  <- [The material base determines the social superstructure]
  <- [Capitalism is inherently exploitative due to surplus value extraction]

[Critics argue Marx underestimates the role of ideology and culture]
  -/-> [The material base determines the social superstructure]
  -/-> [History progresses through dialectical materialism and class struggle]

[Neo-Marxists (e.g., Gramsci) extended Marx's ideas to include hegemony]
  => [The material base determines the social superstructure]

[Weber critiqued Marx’s economic determinism by highlighting multidimensional stratification]
  -/-> [Capitalism is inherently exploitative due to surplus value extraction]

[Marx's theory is empirically weak but normatively powerful]
  => [Marx’s ideas are foundational to conflict theory in sociology]
