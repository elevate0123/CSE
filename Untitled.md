*   **[01:00]** Mention of an abrogated verse (Ayat ar-Rajm) that was once part of this Surah.

---

    *   The Prophet (SAW) is instructed to maintain Taqwa (fear/consciousness of Allah).
    *   He is commanded not to obey the disbelievers and hypocrites.
    *   Allah is All-Knowing (Aleem), All-Wise (Hakeem).

    *   The command to place complete trust and reliance (Tawakkul) in Allah.
    *   Allah is sufficient as a Wakeel (Disposer of affairs, Protector).

---

### 5. Rectification of Pre-Islamic Social Customs (Ayahs 4-5)
*   **[02:43]** Explanation of **Ayah 4 (Ma ja'alallahu lirajulin min qalbaini...)**:
    *   **One Heart:** Allah has not placed two hearts in any man's chest, emphasizing singularity in devotion. Anatomical truth and spiritual message of singular focus on Allah.
    *   **Zihar:** The pre-Islamic practice of Zihar (likening one's wife to one's mother's back to make her unlawful) does not make a wife a mother. It's a mere utterance.
    *   **Adopted Sons:** Adopted sons are not to be treated as biological sons in terms of lineage and legal implications (e.g., inheritance, marriage prohibitions). These are "sayings of your mouths."
*   **[05:21]** Explanation of **Ayah 5 (Ud'oohum li aabaa'ihim...)**:
    *   Adopted sons should be called by their biological father's names; this is more just in Allah's sight.
    *   **Shan-e-Nuzul (Reason for Revelation):** Incident of Hazrat Zaid bin Harithah (RA), who was the Prophet's (SAW) adopted son and was called Zaid bin Muhammad. This Ayah corrected that practice. (Reference: Bukhari 4782).
    *   If the biological father is unknown, they are brothers in faith and Mawali (clients/freed persons).
    *   No sin in unintentional mistakes in this regard, but intentional misattribution is a sin.
    *   **[06:18]** Discussion on permissibility of calling someone "son" or "brother" out of affection, distinct from legal adoption. Cites Hadith:
        *   Prophet (SAW) calling Anas (RA) "Ya Bunayya" (O my little son) (Muslim 2151).
        *   Prophet (SAW) calling companions "brother" and children "my children" (Nasa'i 3064).
    *   **[09:55]** Stern warning against intentionally changing one's lineage or falsely attributing oneself to a people/tribe one doesn't belong to (Hadith: Bukhari 3508, Muslim - "Whoever knowingly attributes himself to someone other than his father has committed kufr"; "let him take his place in Hell").
    *   **[10:49]** Discussion on Ijtihad (scholarly reasoning) in relation to unintentional errors. Hadith: A judge who strives and is correct gets two rewards; if he strives and errs, gets one reward (Bukhari 7352).

---

### 6. The Exalted Status of the Prophet (SAW) and the Believers' Relationship with Him (Ayah 6)
*   **[14:34]** Explanation of **Ayah 6 (An-Nabiyyu awlaa bil mu'mineena min anfusihim...)**:
    *   The Prophet (SAW) is "Awla" (more worthy of, has more right over, is closer to) the believers than their own selves.
    *   His wives are their mothers (Ummahaatuhum), signifying respect and prohibition of marriage to them.
    *   **[15:10]** The term "Awla" signifies a deeper connection and authority than "Mawla."
    *   Hadith elaborating on "Awla": Prophet (SAW) is closer to every believer in this world and the Hereafter; he takes responsibility for the debts and dependents of deceased believers (Bukhari 4781).
    *   Hadith on loving the Prophet (SAW) more than oneself, one's children, and parents (Bukhari 14, referencing the incident with Umar RA, Bukhari 6632).
    *   **[17:19]** The status of the Prophet's wives as "Mothers of the Believers" is linked to the Prophet's (SAW) own exalted status.

---

### 7. Examples of Sahaba's Devotion and Sacrifice for the Prophet (SAW)
*   **[18:36]** Incident of Hazrat Salama bin Akwa' (RA) as a young boy, bravely retrieving the Prophet's (SAW) stolen camels, his courage and poetic utterances during the chase. Prophet (SAW) honored him by seating him behind him on his she-camel. (Bukhari 4194).
*   **[21:52]** Incident of Hazrat Abu Bakr As-Siddiq (RA) ready to fight his own son, Abdur Rahman (before his conversion), in defense of Islam. Prophet (SAW) asked Abu Bakr (RA) to stay, valuing his presence. (Al-Isti'ab by Ibn Abd al-Barr).
*   **[22:31]** Dialogue between Abu Bakr (RA) and his son Abdur Rahman (RA) (after his conversion) regarding the Battle of Badr, highlighting Abu Bakr's (RA) unwavering loyalty to Islam over familial ties. (Sirat Halbiyyah).
*   **[23:05]** Incident of Abu Bakr (RA) slapping his father, Abu Quhafah (before his conversion), for disrespecting the Prophet (SAW). (Durr Manthur, Sirat Halbiyyah).
*   **[23:56]** Hazrat Ali (RA) sleeping in the Prophet's (SAW) bed on the night of Hijrah, offering his life. (Sirat Ibn Hisham).
*   **[24:32]** Hazrat Abu Bakr (RA) entering the Cave of Thawr first to ensure its safety for the Prophet (SAW). (Sirat Ibn Hisham).
*   **[25:00]** Hazrat Umar's (RA) statement: "By Allah, Abu Bakr's one night in the cave is more meritorious than the entire life of Umar." (Mustadrak al-Hakim 4321).

---

### 8. The Covenant of the Prophets (Ayahs 7-8)
*   **[25:34]** Explanation of **Ayah 7 (Wa idh akhadhnaa minan nabiyyeena meethaaqahum...)**:
    *   Allah took a firm covenant from all prophets, including Prophet Muhammad (SAW), Nuh (AS), Ibrahim (AS), Musa (AS), and Isa (AS).
    *   Prophet Muhammad (SAW) is mentioned first in this list, despite being the last prophet chronologically.
    *   **[26:17]** Hadith: "I was the first of the prophets in creation and the last of them in being sent." (Ibn Jarir, Hasan Sanad).
*   **[26:51]** Explanation of **Ayah 8 (Liyas'alas saadiqeena 'an sidqihim...)**:
    *   The purpose of this covenant was so Allah may question the truthful (prophets) about their truthfulness (in delivering the message).
    *   **[27:11]** Refutation of Qadiani misinterpretation that links this covenant to the one in Surah Aal-Imran (3:81) to falsely prophesy another prophet. Peer Sahab clarifies this covenant was about the prophets' duty to convey the message faithfully.

---

### 9. The Battle of the Confederates (Al-Ahzab / Khandaq) (Ayahs 9-27)
*   **[29:46]** Introduction to the events of Ghazwah Al-Ahzab (Battle of the Confederates/Trench), also known as Khandaq.
*   **[30:05]** Explanation of **Ayah 9 (Yaa ayyuhal ladheena aamanudh kuroo ni'matallaahi 'alaikum...)**:
    *   Believers are reminded of Allah's favor during this battle when large enemy confederations (Ahzab) attacked Madinah.
    *   Allah sent a fierce wind (Reeh) and unseen armies of angels (Junoodan lam tarawha) to aid the believers.
*   **[30:57]** Historical Context:
    *   Occurred in the 4th or 5th year of Hijrah.
    *   Coalition forces included Quraysh (led by Abu Sufyan), Ghatafan, Banu Sulaym, and others.
    *   **[31:49]** Prophet's (SAW) strategic decision to dig a trench (Khandaq) based on consultation (possibly Salman Al-Farisi's RA suggestion).
    *   **[31:59]** Incident during trench digging: A large rock that companions couldn't break. Prophet (SAW) struck it, and sparks flew, symbolizing future conquests of Persia (Kisra), Rome (Qaiser), and Yemen. (Dala'il an-Nubuwwah by Bayhaqi).
*   **[33:05]** Hazrat Zubair bin Awwam (RA) volunteering three times to gather intelligence on the enemy. Prophet (SAW) declared, "Every prophet has a Hawari (sincere helper/disciple), and my Hawari is Zubair." (Bukhari 7261). Peer Sahab clarifies this doesn't equate to "Mushkil Kusha" (Remover of difficulties in a divine sense).
*   **[34:55]** Prophet (SAW) and companions reciting poetry while digging the trench in cold weather, expressing their commitment to Jihad. (Bukhari [Hadith number unclear, e.g., 4104, 4106]).
*   **[37:22]** Hardship of the siege: Companions, including Ali (RA), missed Salatul Wusta (Asr prayer) due to the intensity of the fighting, leading to Prophet (SAW) cursing the enemy. (Bukhari 4533).
*   **[39:23]** Explanation of **Ayah 10 (Idh jaa'ookum min fawqikum...)**: Describes the terrifying situation with enemies attacking from multiple directions, and the fear gripping the believers.
*   **[39:47]** Explanation of **Ayah 11 (Hunaalika btuliyal mu'minoona...)**: Believers were severely tested and shaken.
*   **The Role of Hypocrites (Ayahs 12-20):**
    *   **[40:09]** **Ayah 12:** Hypocrites and those with diseased hearts expressed doubt, saying Allah and His Messenger promised only delusion.
    *   **[40:30]** **Ayah 13:** Some tried to demoralize the people of Madinah, urging them to return home, making excuses like their homes being unprotected.
    *   **[41:12]** **Ayah 14:** If the enemy had breached Madinah and asked them to commit apostasy (Fitnah), they would have readily done so.
    *   **[41:42]** **Ayah 15:** They had previously covenanted with Allah not to flee, referring to Banu Harithah.
    *   **[43:11 - 44:01]** **Ayahs 18-19:** Allah knows those who hinder others from Jihad, who are stingy, cowardly in battle but sharp-tongued when demanding spoils.
    *   **[44:23]** **Ayah 20:** Even after the enemy's retreat, hypocrites remained fearful, wishing they were away with Bedouins, only asking for news.
*   **The Believers' Steadfastness (Ayah 22-23):**
    *   **[50:44]** **Ayah 22:** When true believers saw the confederates, their faith increased, affirming Allah's and His Messenger's promise.
    *   **[51:23]** **Ayah 23:** Among believers are men true to their covenant with Allah. Some achieved martyrdom (like Anas bin Nadr RA), others await their chance, never faltering.
    *   **[52:29]** Story of Anas bin Nadr (RA), uncle of Anas bin Malik (RA), who regretted missing Badr. His fierce fighting and martyrdom in Uhud with over 80 wounds. He was recognized only by his sister from his fingertips. Ayah 23 was revealed in context of such men. (Muslim 1903).
*   **Divine Aid and Victory (Ayahs 25-27):**
    *   **[55:12]** **Ayah 25:** Allah repelled the disbelievers in their rage; they gained nothing. Allah sufficed the believers in fighting. Prophet's (SAW) supplication after victory (Bukhari 4114).
    *   **[55:59]** Prophet's (SAW) declaration after Ahzab: "Now we will raid them, and they will not raid us." (Bukhari 4110). Peer Sahab notes this indicates Jihad is not solely defensive.
    *   **[57:04]** **Ayah 26:** Allah brought down Banu Qurayzah (People of the Book who aided the confederates) from their fortresses, casting terror into their hearts. Some were killed, others captured.
    *   **[57:44]** **Ayah 27:** Allah made Muslims inherit their lands, homes, wealth, and lands they hadn't trodden. (Ibn Jarir, Hasan Sanad).

### 10. The Prophet (SAW) as the Uswah Hasanah (Excellent Pattern) (Ayah 21)
*   **[44:54]** Explanation of **Ayah 21 (Laqad kaana lakum fee Rasoolillaahi uswatun hasanah...)**:
    *   The Messenger of Allah (SAW) is the most beautiful and practical example for those who hope in Allah and the Last Day and remember Allah often.
    *   This Ayah establishes the Sunnah (Prophet's words, actions, approvals) as a primary source of guidance.
*   **[45:34]** Examples of Sahaba using this Ayah to derive rulings and emphasize following the Prophet's (SAW) practice:
    *   Abdullah bin Umar (RA) explaining the rites of Umrah (Tawaf of Ka'bah, Sa'i between Safa and Marwa) by detailing the Prophet's (SAW) actions. (Bukhari 395).
    *   Ibn Abbas (RA) explaining that the Prophet (SAW) recited loudly or silently in Salah as commanded, without philosophical questioning. (Bukhari 774).
    *   Abdullah bin Umar (RA) on the permissibility of praying Witr while riding a camel, based on the Prophet's (SAW) practice. (Bukhari 999).
    *   Ibn Umar (RA) stating he did not see the Prophet (SAW) offering optional (Nafl) prayers during travel (except Witr and Sunnah of Fajr). (Bukhari 1101).
*   **[49:30]** Peer Sahab emphasizes the Hujjiyyah (authoritativeness) of Hadith and criticizes those who deny it or try to understand Islam without it.

---

### 11. The Choice (Takhyir) Given to the Wives of the Prophet (SAW) (Ayahs 28-29)
*   **[58:29]** Explanation of **Ayah 28 (Yaa ayyuhan Nabiyyu qul li azwaajika...)**:
    *   The Prophet (SAW) was commanded to offer his wives a choice: either the worldly life and its adornments (in which case he would provide for them and release them graciously) or Allah, His Messenger, and the Hereafter.
*   **[59:06]** The Prophet (SAW) immediately implemented this command.
    *   He first approached Aisha (RA), advising her not to rush and to consult her parents.
    *   **[01:00:28]** Aisha's (RA) immediate response: "Should I consult my parents concerning you, O Messenger of Allah? ... I choose Allah, His Messenger, and the Home of the Hereafter." (Bukhari 4785, 4786).
    *   All other wives made the same choice, preferring Allah and His Messenger over worldly comforts. (Bukhari 5262, Muslim 1478).
*   **[01:01:34]** Explanation of **Ayah 29 (Wa in kuntunna turidnallaaha wa Rasoolahoo...)**:
    *   For those (wives) who choose Allah, His Messenger, and the Hereafter, Allah has prepared a great reward for the محسنات (doers of good) among them.
    *   Peer Sahab uses this to counter negative portrayals of the Prophet's (SAW) household, highlighting their piety and preference for the Hereafter.

---

### 12. The Status and Responsibilities of the Wives of the Prophet (SAW) (Ayah 30)
*   **[02:53]** Explanation of **Ayah 30 (Yaa nisaa'an Nabiyyi man ya'ti minkunna bifaahishatim mubayyinatin...)**:
    *   O Wives of the Prophet, if any of you were to commit a clear immorality (Fahisha Mubayyana), her punishment would be doubled. This is easy for Allah.
    *   **[01:03:08]** Peer Sahab explains that their exalted status comes with greater responsibility and a higher standard. This verse is not a license for others to criticize them but highlights Allah's direct address and standard for His chosen ones.
