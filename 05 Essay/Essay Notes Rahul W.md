### Introduction
#### Doubter is a true man of science
The relationship between doubt and scientific progress is profound and inseparable. **Science, in its purest form, is not about absolute certainties but about the constant questioning of what we think we know.** The scientific method itself is built upon the foundation of skepticism, requiring researchers to challenge hypotheses, scrutinise evidence, and remain open to new possibilities. **A true scientist is, at heart, a professional doubter.**

#### Creativity
Creativity is often perceived **as the domain of the grand and spectacular**, but true inspiration frequently springs **from the effort to find wonder in the everyday**. When we immerse ourselves in the ordinary and look beyond the surface, we uncover worlds within worlds. These moments of "seeing" are what ignite the spark of creativity, shifting the mundane into something sublime. The recognition of beauty in the small and seemingly insignificant leads to innovative expression and creative breakthroughs.

### Anecdotes
#### Alexander Fleming
![[Essay-0.png]]

In the autumn of 1928, a young Alexander Fleming returned to his laboratory after a vacation. What he discovered in his "messy" workspace would change the course of medical history forever. A contaminated Petri dish, forgotten in haste before his departure, had developed a curious mold that seemed to prevent bacterial growth around it. Most scientists would have discarded this "failed" experiment, but Fleming's wandering mind saw possibility where others saw disorder.

This serendipitous discovery of penicillin, born from what many would consider poor laboratory practice, went on to save millions of lives. Fleming's ability to see beyond the conventional, to let his scientific **curiosity wander freely**, led to one of humanity's greatest medical breakthroughs.

As he later reflected, "One sometimes finds what one is not looking for. When I woke up just after dawn on September 28, 1928, I certainly didn't plan to revolutionize all medicine."

#### Charles Darwin
![[Essay-1.png]]
On a crisp December morning in 1831, a young Charles Darwin stood on the deck of the HMS Beagle, watching the shores of England fade into the horizon. At just 22 years old, he was about to embark on a five-year voyage that would forever change his life—and the course of scientific history. With a notebook in hand and curiosity in his eyes, Darwin was eager to explore the uncharted territories of South America and the mysterious Galápagos Islands.

During his Voyage, Darwin meticulously collected and catalogued plant and animal specimens while serving as the ship's naturalist. While he did it out of interest as he was a naturalist, the wanderness/doubt in him led him to explore how similar creatures on different islands had adapted to their specific environments and fossils of extinct creatures bore uncanny resemblances to living species, challenging the notion of fixed, unchangeable life forms.

### Connections to body
#### Not all who wander..
The notion "Not all who wander are lost" suggests a profound distinction between wandering and being lost. Wandering is a form of exploration, of seeking knowledge or a deeper understanding without necessarily knowing the precise endpoint. This idea challenges the conventional association of wandering with aimlessness, implying instead that wandering can lead to profound discovery and growth. The individuals who embark on such journeys often break free from societal expectations, guided by internal compasses that others may not perceive or understand.

---
### Dimensions
#### Shadows dancing on cave walls
The ancient Greek philosopher Plato warned us about accepting shadows as reality in his famous Cave Allegory. Those chained in the cave believed the shadows they saw were reality, never questioning their perceptions.

The scientist, like Plato's freed prisoner, must first doubt what they see. They must question whether what appears as truth might merely be shadows dancing on cave walls. This fundamental skepticism forms the bedrock of scientific inquiry.

As Albert Einstein once remarked, "The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existence." This sentiment echoes through millennia, from Plato's cave to modern laboratories.

#### Footprints of the Soul
#### Seeds of Skepticism
From the dawn of human thought, curiosity has driven us to seek understanding. Early philosophers gazed at the stars, pondering the mysteries of the universe. Their initial acceptance of myths gave way to skepticism as they sought empirical evidence to explain natural phenomena.

Doubt ignites the quest for knowledge. It challenges us to look beyond appearances and question the status quo. Without skepticism, there would be no impetus to investigate or innovate, leaving humanity stagnant in ignorance.

As René Descartes stated, "If you would be a real seeker after truth, it is necessary that at least once in your life you doubt, as far as possible, all things." Doubt is thus the seed from which scientific inquiry sprouts, encouraging us to delve deeper into the unknown

#### Serendipity's Sacred Dance
The **role of chance encounters** and unexpected discoveries in human progress cannot be understated. Many groundbreaking scientific discoveries, from penicillin to X-rays, emerged from what appeared to be **aimless experimentation or fortunate accidents.**

These moments of serendipity aren't truly random but rather the result of **prepared minds wandering through possibilities**, ready to recognize significance in the unexpected. They represent the intersection of preparation and opportunity, where wandering leads to wonderful discoveries.

As Louis Pasteur eloquently stated, "Chance favors the prepared mind." This preparedness, combined with the willingness to wander into unknown territories, has been the catalyst for numerous scientific breakthroughs.

#### Exploration examples
*   Some journeys seem impossible because no one has ever done it before. For instance, thinking of **putting a man on the moon** - seems like stuff for the dreams. Other journeys feel impossible because you've not done it before.

#### Exploration fodder points
*   Fear of failure - Thomas Edison failed a 1000 times before he invented the light bulb
*   It is a mindset - add example here
*   Similarly, there will be ample things in life that will try to stop your progress. A roadblock that will seem impossible to pass. Arunima's story, of how a girl, with her legs amputated, can even think of climbing Mount Everest is a story for the legends.
*   Individual
    *   It is a matter of channelling your inner strength and mustering courage to set out on an unexplored journey.
*   20p concept at Google for Exploration - working on projects that people are passionate about

## Topic (2): Happiness
#### PYQ:
*   There is no path to happiness, Happiness is the path (2024)
*   A smile is the chosen vehicle for all ambiguities (2022)

#### Ethics PYQ:
*   Happiness is not something ready made. It comes from your own actions we obtain peace within ourselves (2021)

#### Quotes
*   "If you want others to be happy, practice compassion. If you want to be happy, practice compassion." - Dalai Lama
*   “Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony.” - Mahatma Gandhi
*   "No medicine cures what happiness cannot." - Gabriel García Márquez
*   "The question is not what you look at, but what you see." - Thoreau

#### Anecdotes
##### Epicurus
![[Essay-2.png]]

In the final days of his life, despite experiencing excruciating pain from urinary problems and dysentery, Epicurus found solace in philosophical contemplation. Rather than dwelling on his physical suffering, he chose to relive his happiest memories, demonstrating that happiness isn't a destination but a state of mind. In his final letter to one of his friends, he wrote about experiencing joy even on his deathbed, showing that happiness can coexist with suffering.

The path to happiness isn't about reaching a specific goal or destination; rather, it's about finding joy in the journey itself. This understanding transforms our perspective from seeing happiness as an endpoint to recognizing it as a way of living. The search for happiness becomes less about "arriving" and more about "being."

##### Thoreau
![[Essay-3.png]]

Hence Thoreau stated - "Happiness is like a butterfly, the more you chase it, the more it will evade you, but if you notice the other things around you, it will gently come and sit on your shoulder."

#### What is happiness?
Happiness is an emotional state characterized by feelings of joy, satisfaction, contentment, and fulfillment. While happiness has many different definitions, it is often described as involving positive emotions and life satisfaction. Another definition of happiness comes from the ancient philosopher Aristotle, who suggested that happiness is the one human desire, and all other human desires exist as a way to obtain happiness.

#### Introduction
The human pursuit of happiness has been a central theme throughout civilization, from ancient philosophical treatises to modern psychological studies. We often view happiness as an elusive endpoint, something to be achieved after we accomplish certain goals or acquire specific possessions. This perspective, however, fundamentally misunderstands the nature of happiness itself.

Happiness isn't a distant shore we must reach after a long voyage; it's the very act of sailing itself. When we understand that each moment carries the potential for joy, gratitude, and meaning, we begin to see that happiness isn't something we chase but rather something we practise and embody in our daily lives.

This essay explores the multifaceted dimensions of happiness as a path, delving into various perspectives that illuminate how embracing the journey enriches our existence. By examining insights from thinkers, leaders, psychologists, and scientists, we unravel the essence of living a fulfilled life. Each dimension invites us to consider how shifting our focus from destination to journey can transform our understanding of happiness.

#### Embracing the Now
In our fast-paced society, the present moment often slips through our fingers as we chase future aspirations or dwell on past regrets. We find ourselves caught in a cycle of "I'll be happy when..." statements, postponing joy for future events. This relentless pursuit blinds us to the beauty unfolding in the here and now.

By focusing on the present, we align ourselves with the flow of life, finding happiness in the simple act of being. Mindfulness teaches us to savor each experience, turning ordinary moments into extraordinary ones. It encourages us to engage fully with our surroundings, thoughts, and feelings without judgment.

As the philosopher Eckhart Tolle states, "Realize deeply that the present moment is all you ever have." Embracing the now allows us to experience life's richness fully, making happiness a constant companion rather than a distant destination.

#### Dancing with daily delights
The first rays of morning light filter through your window, casting a golden glow on the mundane moments of daily life. These simple instances – the warmth of your morning coffee, the gentle rustle of leaves, the smile of a stranger - are not mere stepping stones to happiness but are themselves the essence of joy.

Positive psychologist Dr. Martin Seligman emphasizes that authentic happiness comes from finding pleasure and meaning in everyday experiences. Through his research, he discovered that individuals who practice mindful appreciation of daily moments report higher levels of life satisfaction than those constantly pursuing larger goals.

"The pleasant life, the engaged life, and the meaningful life are not mutually exclusive. The richest life has all three," Seligman notes. This understanding reinforces the idea that happiness resides in our ability to embrace and celebrate the ordinary moments that make up our days.

#### Nurturing Seeds of Gratitude
Gratitude can increase happiness and inculcate it into the path.

Professor Robert Emmons, a leading gratitude researcher, discovered through extensive studies that individuals who maintain gratitude journals report significantly higher levels of happiness and life satisfaction. This wasn't merely about counting blessings, but about actively recognizing the abundance that exists in each moment.

The practice of gratitude **transforms our perspective from what's missing to what's present**. It's **not about waiting to be grateful when everything is perfect, but finding reasons for thankfulness in our current circumstances.**

This aligns perfectly with Maya Angelou's observation: "Be present in all things and thankful for all things." Through her words and life, she demonstrated how gratitude isn't just an attitude but a path itself to experiencing happiness.

#### Weaving Bonds of Connection
Human beings are inherently social creatures, and our happiness is inextricably linked to the quality of our relationships. **The warmth of human connection isn't just a path to happiness – it is happiness itself manifested in shared moments.**

Harvard's longest-running study on happiness, spanning over 80 years, led by Dr. Robert Waldinger, conclusively shows that good relationships keep us happier and healthier. The study emphasizes that it's not the quantity but the quality of relationships that matters.

## Topic (4): Rising every time we fall/failure/facing challenges
(This can include Risk acceptance/aversion & embracing challenges)

#### Sample questions:
*   "Our greatest glory is not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall"

#### Quotes
*   "Failure is the stepping stone to success"
*   The darkest hour is just before dawn. - Thomas Fuller, a 17th-century English historian and author
*   But I know, somehow, that only when it is dark enough can you see the stars. — Martin Luther King, Jr.

#### Anecdotes/Examples
##### Anecdote of Nelson Mandela
On the inauguration of his presidency, Nelson Mandela was asked by a reporter about what had kept him going all these years against the Apartheid regime - even after two dozen years in prison. Mandela's answer was simple: he quoted his favourite poem 'Invictus' and remarked 'I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul.' He said that when one falls, the next obvious step is to pull oneself up, dust off the clothes and keep moving on; for that is what glory was and will be.

##### Greek legends
Greek legends like the Odyssey and the Iliad explore the real nature of 'glory' and heroism. They showcase the axiom that an ordinary man becomes a 'symbol of glory' not because he had always been a noble aristocrat worshipped by others, but because he fought impending consequences and failures - only to overcome the enemy and secure penultimate justice. Homer's protagonist Ulysses does it and so does the meek boy David against the monstrous Goliath.

![[Essay-4.png]]

##### Example of Earth
The classic case of Earth as a living being in all its wholeness is a case of extinction and rejuvenation. Earth has experienced several ages of mass extinction from the Precambrian to the Permian. However, this beautiful and majestic planet continues to nurture life for over 4.8 million years now. Thus, life on Earth falls and rises again in all its glory.

##### Winston Churchill during WW2
In the grim winter of 1940, Churchill stood alone in his study at 10 Downing Street, the weight of Nazi victories across Europe bearing down on his shoulders. Reports of falling nations and advancing German forces littered his desk. Britain seemed destined to be next.

Yet, amidst the darkness, Prime Minister Winston Churchill refused to yield. With stirring speeches, he rallied the British people, igniting a flame of resilience and hope. "We shall fight on the beaches," he declared, "we shall never surrender."

Churchill's unwavering spirit became the beacon that guided Britain through its darkest hours. His leadership proved that even when the night is at its blackest, the dawn is just moments away, leading ultimately to the triumph over tyranny.

#### Potential arguments
Positive attitude

##### Advantages of being Hopeful
In the face of adversity, everyone has two options- first, to succumb to it and second, to be hopeful and make the best out of it. Hope offers motivation, optimism, perseverance, manages stress and anxiety, inspires action, increases self-confidence and builds resilience. Hope makes life worth living.

Enlightenment thinker René Descartes considers hope as a weaker form of confidence. It's a desire for a good outcome that's possible, with the expectation that it's likely but not certain. War-torn countries like Palestine, Ukraine can be hopeful for political stability and order.

Counter argument to Hope
Google's "Hope is not a strategy" by SRE -> enables the infra to keep running

##### Disadvantages of being Hopeful
*   Disappointment and defeat
*   Obfuscate reality
*   Promotes desire - Buddha considers desire as the root cause of suffering. Hope at times can promote inaction and passiveness.

##### Benefit of failure (by Freud)
Sigmund Freud in his papers on psychoanalysis remarks that **failure** expands the potential of human cognition. It presents an individual with a different perspective and a distinguished set of options. One of these options - which is the simplest and the hardest - always leads to success and glory.

##### Facing challenges/failures (by Carl Jung)
Jung believed that confronting and working through our difficulties, failures, and shadow aspects is essential for psychological growth and individuation. Avoiding these challenges prevents us from developing a more integrated and authentic self.

If you don't reform, you don't grow. And the need to reform is always highlighted by visible failures and inadequacies.

## Topic (5): Feminism & Patriarchy
#### PYQs:
*   Girls are weighed down by restrictions, boys with demands – two equally harmful disciplines. (2023)
*   Hand that rocks the cradle rules the world. (2021)
*   Patriarchy is the least noticed yet the most significant structure of social inequality. (2020)
*   Fulfilment of 'new woman' in India is myth. (2017)

#### What is Feminism?
GD Anderson has slightly quoted, "Feminism is not about making women strong. They are already strong. It is to change the perception of the world of how it seeks women's strength."

#### The Pill
In 1960, the US FDA approved the birth control pill, freeing women from the restrictions of child-bearing. Women were now free to study or work because they were more productive members of society, and prevented themselves from the upbringing of a child for whom they weren't psychologically or financially ready. When the other half of the population is more independent & efficient, does it not enhance the aggregate pie? Does bodily autonomy not promote sound generation of youngsters who are wanted & physical health?

#### Mary Wollstonecraft & JS Mill
To be a feminist in any authentic sense is to **want for all persons, female & male, liberation from sexist roles, domination & oppression**. The first wave of feminism is marked often with the French Revolution & Mary Wollstonecraft (the mother of Feminism). It was mainly a suffragette movement JS Mill's work in the **'Subjection of Women'** raised the pertinent question that even if **women were of an inherently different nature**, their potential can be tested with the democratic experiment. He believed that **confining women to the four walls of family was neither good for women nor society.**

#### Feminism from the Vedic Age
Highly educated, particularly in Vedic literature and philosophy. **Gargi** is remembered for her sharp intellect, independence, and **courage in challenging the greatest philosophical minds of her time**. Her story highlights the role of women in intellectual and spiritual traditions in ancient India, especially in the Vedic age, where **she stood out as one of the few prominent female figures in philosophy**. Her contributions are seen as a symbol of women's participation in the quest for knowledge and understanding of the self and the universe.

#### Current status (update the numbers)
Yet more than 3000 years later we live in the same dismal numbers. Less than 14% women in its parliament, less than 15% researchers in science and a literacy rate that is 10% lower than that of men. Whether such dismal numbers have any far-reaching repercussions is explored in the following paragraphs.

#### Feminism & Economy: Miles to go before we sleep (update the numbers)
Globally, women earn only three quarters as much as men despite similar jobs & education. They remain underrepresented in the formal sector & over represented in the informal one. They spend twice as much time on household chores & four times the time on child care as compared to men.

This highlights how women are underutilised, underpaid and overstretched. Amartya Sen has played a pioneering role in paying attention to the "missing women", he emphasises on the capability approach to mainstream for women. India's labour force participation rate is astonishingly low at 20%. Not only that, it is also declining. Empowering women with education, skills & freedom to make choices can help to boost India's GDP by a whopping 27% as per IMF.

Women's exemplary sense of financial responsibility is showcased by the example of women-led Self Help Groups which have a loan repayment rate of 97% which is even better than Corporate.

Thus, the need of the hour is a massive campaign to not just bring women in the workforce but also retain them. As per IAS Smita Sabharwal, the biological clock is ticking simultaneously with the professional clock, so we must bring women friendly policies to help them return to work post pregnancy.

## Topic (6): Climate Change
### Anecdote
#### Young girl Sapna
A five year old girl, Sahna lives in a coastal village of Odisha. She dreams of becoming a pilot. One evening, she is playing on the beach with her brother and making a castle of sand. Suddenly, there are announcements by the local government that a fast moving cyclone is approaching the village. In just a few hours, the whole village is devastated. Sapna loses her parents and her house. The castle she built is broken and so are her dreams. Sapna is a victim of climate change.

### Notes
*   It is morally wrong to tell developing countries to abandon their aspirations for better living standards so that developed countries can maintain their ways of living in cleaner environments and cooler climates.
*   Even as developed nations prepare to impose a **carbon tax** at the border on imports coming into their countries laden with carbon, they are ramping up energy demand like never before, thanks to their latest obsession with letting Artificial Intelligence (AI) guide, take over and dominate natural intelligence.
*   In a research report published in April, analysts in Goldman Sachs wrote that the demand for power in the United States would experience a growth not seen in a generation, thanks to Al and that "transmission, one of the major bottlenecks for clean energy transition, and the addition of data centres and Al could exacerbate this".

##### Importance/benefit of Wisdom (King Solomon)
![[Essay-5.png]]

When young Solomon ascended to the throne of Israel, he was acutely aware of the immense responsibility that rested on his shoulders. The weight of leading a great nation felt overwhelming, and he recognized his own limitations. One night, seeking guidance and clarity, he journeyed to a template and poured out his heart in **earnest** prayer.

That night, God appeared to Solomon and said, "Ask for whatever you want me to give you." Faced with this incredible offer, Solomon could have requested wealth, long life, or the defeat of his enemies. Instead, he humbly replied, "Give your servant an understanding heart to govern your people and to discern between right and wrong." His deepest desire was for wisdom to lead justly and compassionately.

God was deeply pleased with Solomon's selfless request. Not only did He grant Solomon unparalleled wisdom, but He also bestowed upon him riches and honour beyond measure. Solomon's reign became legendary for its prosperity and peace, all rooted in the wisdom he received. His story inspires us to seek wisdom above all else.

#### What is knowledge & wisdom?
Knowledge, in its broadest sense, encompasses the accumulation of facts, information, and skills acquired through education and experience. It is the foundation upon which our understanding of the world is built.
Wisdom is the judicious application of knowledge, characterised by a deep understanding of life and human nature.

Knowledge is primarily additive whereas wisdom is cultivated through a process of subtraction—distilling and refining what we know to uncover deeper truths and insights.

#### Quotes
"To attain **knowledge**, add things every day. To attain **wisdom**, remove things every day."-Lao Tzu

#### Accumulation vs Simplification (knowledge & wisdom)
*   Knowledge involves gathering information, wisdom is about distilling and simplifying that information.
*   Quote: "Knowledge is a process of piling up facts; wisdom lies in their simplification." – Martin H. Fischer

#### Dunning-Kruger Effect
The Dunning-Kruger effect (studied in 1999) is a cognitive bias in which individuals with limited knowledge or competence in a particular domain tend to overestimate their own ability. Conversely, those with higher competence may underestimate their relative skills. This phenomenon highlights a discrepancy between perceived and actual performance, often leading to inflated self-assessments among the less skilled.

For example, if beginners in any field believe that they already possess the requisite knowledge, they will never be able to improve and will lag behind in life.

#### Anti-vaccine movement
For example, the anti-vaccine movement seen during COVID-19 pandemic took many precious lives because of fabricated truth spread by some people on platforms like whatsapp which was not backed by medical science.

#### Education that encourages thought
*   Critical thinking and problem-solving exercises based on case studies, debates, and project-based learning should be integrated into the curriculum.
*   Example of Cambridge - how they push for new knowledge
*   Interdisciplinary approach: There should be integration of courses from science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) and the students should have a holistic approach towards life, not limited to academics.
    *   Example Civil Services Examination
*   Analytical, open-book exams
*   20p concept at Google for Exploration - working on projects that people are passionate about

#### Examples of people who were original thinkers or thoughtful
*   Scientific discovery - Albert Einstein ‘**Theory of relativity**"
*   Innovations: Steve Jobs in his 2005 Stanford speech talks about '**Connecting the dots**' and how he used his knowledge of calligraphy classes in integrating design principles while launching Apple products such as iphones and ipads.
*   Intellectual revolutions: The ideas of liberty, equality, fraternity, justice, etc. which reverberates every now and then in different parts of the world were given by intellectuals such as Rousseau, Kant, Voltaire, etc. during the Enlightenment in 17th-18th century Europe. These ideas led to revolutions in France, America, Russia, etc. and resulted in the establishment of a new world order.
*   Educational reforms: Maria Montessori was a trained physician but had deep insights on child development. Her innovative thinking led to the development of the Montessori method, which emphasises self-directed as well as collaborative learning and is used across countries in imparting education.
*   New Business strategies: The concept of factory line which revolutionised production mechanism using 'Assembly Line' was brought by Henry Ford. It was possible because he had extensive knowledge about principles of manufacturing and he was an innovative thinker.

#### Justice as the objective of Law
It was only in the 16th century that 'justice' was seen as the main objective of Law. Francis Bacon and René Descartes opined that laws are codified in order to provide each individual his due in civil society. This idea was further propagated by John Locke and Baruch Spinoza.

After acceptance of 'justice' as the primary motive of law - the question was regarding what was meant by justice and how could more justice be guaranteed by more laws? Karl Marx posited that 'from each according to his effort, to each according to his need' was justice. John Rawls in his 'Theory of Justice' remarked that rationality was the basis of law and justice.

#### Anecdotes
##### Company ethics
A classic case of ethical leadership in business is **“the Chicago Tylenol poisonings.”** On September 9, 1982, a 12-year-old girl woke up with a cold. Her parents gave her a tablet of extra-strength Tylenol to ease her symptoms and, within hours, she died. Six more deaths followed—the connecting factor between them was having taken extra-strength Tylenol shortly before passing away. It was later discovered that the tablets were laced with cyanide, a chemical that interferes with the body's ability to use oxygen. Johnson & Johnson, Tylenol's parent company, **had an ethical dilemma and a public relations disaster to contend with.**

Baffled as to how the cyanide got in the tablets, Johnson & Johnson's leaders acted quickly and pulled all Tylenol products off the shelves—31 million bottles worth over $100 million—and stopped all production and advertising. The swiftness of their decision, although incredibly costly, put customers' well-being at the forefront and saved lives. The company offered a $100,000 reward and provided detailed updates on its investigation and product developments following the crisis.

When it became clear that **a killer had bought the product, laced it with cyanide, and returned it to store shelves undetected**, Johnson & Johnson developed the first-ever tamper-resistant packaging. **The “safety seal” that now covers the opening of most food and drug products was born. “Our highest responsibility has always been the health and safety of our consumers,”** a Johnson & Johnson representative wrote in a newspaper. "While this tragic incident remains unsolved, this event resulted in important industry improvements to patient safety measures, including the creation of tamper-resistant packaging.” The Tylenol brand recovered from the incident, largely because of the ethical team and leadership of Johnson & Johnson's.

#### Individual/leader ethics
##### What are values?
Values are the **fundamental principles that guide our behaviour and shape our character**. They are the beliefs and standards that we hold dear and strive to live by. The significance of values is clearly visible in the following words of **Elvis Presley who said that, “Values are like fingerprints. Nobody's are the same, but you leave them all over everything you do”.** While values may vary from person to person and culture to culture, they are an essential part of what it means to be human. While values may be shaped by our culture, family, and personal experiences, they ultimately reflect our sense of what is right, good, and important in life.

## Topic (21): Perfection
#### PYQ:
*   The cost of being wrong is less than the cost of doing nothing
*   There are better practices to 'best practices'. (2021)

#### Quotes:
*   Perfect is the enemy of good - Voltaire (French Writer)
*   "Better a diamond with a flaw than a pebble without."- Confucius
*   "If I waited for perfection, I would never write a word."- Margaret Atwood (Man Booker Prize winner for her book The Handmaid's Tale)
*   "Success is stumbling from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm" - Winston Churchill

#### Anecdote
##### Anecdote (Perfectionism)
Story of one best pot vs many good pots: In a ceramic class at a college, a professor divided students into 2 groups A and B. Group A was asked to make 1 pot every day for next 100 days, irrespective of the quality it had. Group B was asked to make only 1 pot in the next 100 days, but it was supposed to be the perfect one. After 100 days, the professor got an astonishing result. When he chose the top 20 pots in terms of quality, all the pots were from Group A, who had focussed on making 'good' pots. Surprisingly, the so-called 'best' pot made by Group B could not find its place in the category of even top 50 pots.

This lesson exemplifies how the relentless pursuit of perfection can paralyse decision-making, while embracing “good enough” can yield remarkable results, especially when time is of the essence.

##### Anecdote Bezos & Roosevelt (cost of doing nothing) (#done)
In 1995, when Jeff Bezos contemplated leaving his lucrative Wall Street job to start an online bookstore, he applied what he called the "regret minimization framework." He imagined himself at age 80, looking back at his life choices. Would he regret not taking this chance more than potentially failing? This framework led him to take the leap, resulting in the creation of Amazon.

Theodore Roosevelt, in his famous **"Man in the Arena" speech**, eloquently captured this sentiment when he declared that **glory belongs not to the critic, but to the person who dares to act, even if they fail**. His words continue to inspire action-takers worldwide.

This philosophical approach - that the cost of being wrong is less than the cost of doing nothing - has shaped transformative moments throughout history, from scientific breakthroughs to business innovations.

#### Bridge from intro to body (one sentence pending)
The pursuit of perfection can potentially blind individuals, organisations, and societies to practical solutions that are readily attainable, creating unnecessary obstacles.

#### Errors as Life's Teachers (Personal)
"The person who never made a mistake never tried anything new" - Albert Einstein
*   This fundamental principle underlies all personal and professional growth. Einstein's perspective validates that innovation requires embracing the possibility of failure.

#### Learning from mistakes enables growth
The fear of being wrong is deeply ingrained in our psychological makeup. From early childhood, we learn to associate mistakes with embarrassment, punishment, or failure. This evolutionary heritage served us well when a wrong decision meant becoming prey to a predator.

In today's complex world, however, this fear can become a paralytic force. The irony lies in how our attempt to avoid mistakes through inaction often becomes our biggest mistake. As psychologist Carol Dweck (author of the book Mindset) notes in her research on growth mindset, "In a growth mindset, challenges are exciting rather than threatening. So rather than thinking, oh, I'm going to reveal my weaknesses, " you say, wow, here's a chance to grow."

#### Benefit of failure (by Freud)
Sigmund Freud in his papers on psychoanalysis remarks that **failure expands the potential of human cognition**. It presents an individual with a different perspective and a distinguished set of options. One of these options - which is the simplest and the hardest - always leads to success and glory.

#### Develop a more integrated & authentic self (by Carl Jung)
Jung believes that confronting and working through our **difficulties, failures, and shadow aspects is essential for psychological growth and individuation**. Avoiding these challenges prevents us from **developing a more integrated and authentic self.**

If you don't reform, you don't grow. And the need to reform is always highlighted by visible failures and inadequacies.

#### Makes one adaptable (personal or business)
In a rapidly evolving world, the ability to adapt and pivot is more crucial than ever. Clinging to old ways of doing things out of fear of being wrong can lead to obsolescence. The cost of not changing often far exceeds the cost of making mistakes while attempting to adapt.

As Charles Darwin noted, "It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is most adaptable to change."

This principle applies equally to individuals, organisations (e.g. Netflix switched from DVDs to streaming service), societies, and countries (UAE attempting tourism industry pivot). (Add examples of individuals, organisations, and societies)

#### (-ve) Risk aversion behaviour
*   Fortune favour the brave - Voltaire (French writer)
*   "In the end, we only regret the chances we didn't take." — Lewis Carroll (Author of book Alice in Wonderland)
*   How Google overcomes the "fear of making mistakes" - To learn from the mistakes that cause outages in Google's system which also lead to loss of revenue, Google has implemented a blameless postmortem culture of each outage...

#### (-ve) Impact of Perfectionism on Mental health & well-being
Perfectionism is linked to anxiety, depression. The constant pursuit of flawless performance **creates a relentless, exhausting cycle**. Instead, focusing on achievable standards allows for a healthier mental state, fostering resilience and self-compassion.

Psychologist **Dr. Brené Brown** notes that, **“Perfectionism is a twenty-ton shield** that we lug around thinking it will protect us when, in fact, it's the thing that's really preventing us from taking flight."

#### Diamonds Under Pressure
Pressure and resistance, often feared as harbingers of failure, are actually essential catalysts for growth and transformation. Like carbon under pressure becomes diamond, challenges faced head-on forge strength.

Friedrich Nietzsche's famous words ring true: "What doesn't kill you makes you stronger." This philosophy emphasizes how facing potential failure builds resilience.

#### Professional & Business
##### Dancing with the Shadows of Risk
The business world provides countless examples of companies that died not from taking wrong actions, but from taking no action at all. Kodak, despite inventing the digital camera in 1975, failed to embrace digital photography for fear of cannibalizing its film business.

Consider Nokia, once the world's leading mobile phone manufacturer. Their reluctance to adapt to the smartphone revolution, rooted in fear of departing from their successful feature phone model, led to their eventual decline. As Clayton Christensen, author of "The Innovator's Dilemma," observed, "Companies that only focus on what they're good at right now will eventually fail."

##### The paralysis of perfection (Steve jobs "Real artists ships", Reid Hoffman)
In the corporate world, waiting for ideal conditions or perfect products can cost a company its competitive edge. Steve Jobs, despite his attention to design, understood this when he launched the first iPhone with imperfections. **“Real artists ship,”** he famously said, acknowledging that innovation requires releasing products before they are perfect. The iPhone's success speaks to the value of prioritising action over endless refinement.

Similarly, Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn, captures this idea succinctly: "If you're not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you've launched too late." This philosophy emphasises that imperfect action trumps perfect inaction.

#### Social & Political
##### Demonetization: Bold Steps Forward
Demonetization in 2016 demonstrated how action, despite its immediate disruptions, led to increased digital transactions and tax compliance. While the transition was challenging, the cost of not addressing black money and tax evasion would have been far greater.

As Mahatma Gandhi noted, "You may never know what results come from your action. But if you do nothing, there will be no result".

##### GST Implementation: Unifying an economy
The implementation of GST in India represented a massive overhaul of the tax system. Despite initial complications and business disruptions, the unification of India's market has proved more valuable than maintaining the status quo of fragmented tax regimes.

##### Justice's Progressive March (Uniform Civil Code)
Social advancements often come through collective action, even when outcomes are uncertain. Efforts for change require participants to step into the unknown & uncertain.

Inaction maintains the status quo, while action, even if flawed, paves the way for societal evolution. Collective efforts bring about reforms and innovations.

The debate around Uniform Civil Code shows how even controversial reforms can lead to important societal discussions about equality and justice. While implementation challenges exist, the cost of perpetual legal inequality may be greater.

##### Health's Imperfect Progress (TB in India)
India's battle against tuberculosis presents a compelling case for imperfect action over perfect planning. While WHO data shows an impressive 18% decline in TB incidence over eight years - more than double the global rate of 8% - the pace still falls short of India's ambitious 2025 elimination target. Yet, this "insufficient" progress represents millions of lives saved through immediate action, even if the methods weren't optimal. The alternative - waiting for perfect solutions while the disease continues to claim lives - would have been far more costly.

Winston Churchill's wisdom resonates deeply here: "Perfection is the enemy of progress."

##### Scientific progress & technological advancements
###### Innovation - the dance of trial & error
The march of human progress has always been **propelled by those willing to experiment, fail, and learn**. Every significant breakthrough in science, technology, and human knowledge has come **through a process of trial and error, where being wrong was simply a step toward being right.**

Thomas Edison's famous quote illuminates this perfectly: "I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work." His persistence in the face of repeated failures ultimately led to the invention of the light bulb, demonstrating that being wrong repeatedly was a necessary part of eventual success.

(Add SpaceX example here)

#### The Eternal Dance of Progress (History)
History shows that civilizations advance not through caution alone, but through bold experiments. **Some fail, but others transform the world**. The Renaissance emerged from **questioning established truths**, the Industrial Revolution from risky innovations.

Historian Yuval Noah Harari observes in "Sapiens" that human progress has always depended on **our ability to act despite uncertainty**. Our greatest achievements came not from waiting for certainty, but from calculated risks and learning from failures.

As philosopher Karl Popper stated, "All life is problem solving." The solution to problems requires action, and action always carries the risk of being wrong. Yet the alternative – inaction – guarantees stagnation.

#### Examples where cost of being wrong > cost of doing nothing
##### When Silence Saves
Military actions taken without adequate diplomatic efforts often lead to catastrophic consequences. The cost of rushed military responses to border incidents can escalate into full-scale conflict.

India's measured response to the 2020 Galwan Valley clash with China exemplifies the importance of prioritizing diplomacy over hasty military action. India chose to engage in multiple rounds of diplomatic and military talks, leading to a disengagement agreement in October 2024.

This approach prevented further escalation and facilitated the restoration of peace along the disputed border. By avoiding immediate military retaliation, India mitigated the risk of a full-scale conflict, underscoring the value of diplomatic engagement in resolving international disputes. In this case, the cost of doing nothing initially rather than being wrong was beneficial.

##### Mistakes That Echo Eternity
In the realm of criminal justice, wrongful executions are irreversible tragedies. Convicting and executing an innocent person is a grievous error that outweighs the risks of keeping a suspect incarcerated while pursuing further evidence.
The cost of being wrong in such cases is the loss of innocent life, a price too high compared to the potential consequences of delayed justice. It underscores the need for meticulous care before irreversible actions are taken.

#### Solutions for today
##### Nature's Puzzles being solved in Silicon Valley
Before DeepMind's AlphaFold 2, the scientific community's cautious approach to protein structure prediction meant that millions of proteins remained unstudied, potentially delaying life-saving medical breakthroughs. The cost of this inaction was immense – countless potential treatments remained undiscovered due to the fear of investing in wrong approaches.

##### Digital Twins of Tomorrow's Dreams
While many organizations remain paralyzed by fear of costly mistakes in infrastructure changes, the emergence of **digital twin technology demonstrates how the fear of being wrong need not stifle progress**. Companies that refused to upgrade aging facilities due to risk concerns lost billions in inefficiencies, while those embracing digital twins for testing reduced implementation risks by 25-30% while improving operations.

#### Conclusion sample
As we face unprecedented global challenges, our path forward lies not in avoiding mistakes, but in embracing imperfect action.

#### An incident showing that it was his duty to fight for himself & for others
Gandhi was on his way from Durban to Pretoria when, on the night of June 7, 1893, a railway official demanded he relinquish his first class seat and move to the third class compartment. Gandhi refused, saying that he held a valid first-class ticket.

This led to a police constable being summoned, and Gandhi being ejected from the train at the Pietermaritzburg station. He spent the night shivering in the station's waiting room, as he resolved to fight racial discrimination.

The Pietermaritzburg incident is viewed by Gandhians to be one of the most crucial moments in Gandhi's life. As he wrote in his autobiography, what happened to him was “only a symptom of the deep disease of colour prejudice,” and he felt it was his “duty” to fight it.

#### Compassion for Animals
Mahatma Gandhi, a key figure in India's struggle for independence, was known for his philosophy of non-violence (ahimsa). His circle of compassion extended beyond humans to include all living beings. There's an anecdote where Gandhi, while leading the Salt March in 1930, stopped to rescue a wounded dog along the way. This act exemplified his belief that true compassion embraces all creatures, not just humans.

### Compassion
#### Anecdote - Compassion deficit anecdote towards animals
![[Essay-7.png]]

On a cold morning in 1844, a solitary great auk stood on Iceland's Eldey Island, unaware it represented the last of a species that just **half a century earlier had thrived in millions**. The speed of its extinction was staggering - in mere decades, European and American hunters had **decimated the population for meat, eggs, and feathers.**

Three fishermen spotted this final bird through the mist. Despite surviving in the North Atlantic for over thousands of years, the **great auk proved defenceless against industrial-scale hunting**. The species' collapse from abundance to extinction demonstrates humanity's devastating efficiency.

Yet this tragic speed of loss became a powerful wake-up call, catalyzing the birth of modern conservation laws and forcing humanity to confront its capacity for destruction. Today, the great auk stands as a symbol of what we've lost and what we must protect.

#### Reverence for Life (Albert Schweitzer) & Ahimsa
Albert Schweitzer's (Nobel peace prize winner) “Reverence for Life" is a profound ethical framework that calls for deep respect and compassion towards all living beings.
*   Schweitzer posited that all living beings possess inherent worth, regardless of their species, status, or utility to humans.
*   Every form of life, from humans to animals to plants, deserves respect and ethical consideration

##### Animal exploitation
*   **Animal Exploitation in Industrial Farming**: Lack of compassion towards animals in industrial farming practices can lead to **cruelty, unethical treatment, and environmental pollution**. Ex, inhumane killing of pigs for food in Australia -> they are placed in gassing chambers with high concentration of CO2 where pigs lose consciousness within 20-30 seconds and death occurs after about 2.5 mins of exposure. It is done because it enables higher processing speeds of up to 400 pigs per hour.

## Metaphors
### Ebb & Flow
Ebb and flow is a metaphorical term that describes a recurring pattern of change, often involving rise and fall or increase and decrease. It's derived from the natural movement of tides, where the water level rises (flows) and then falls (ebbs).

Here are some common uses of "ebb and flow":
*   Emotional state: "Her emotions ebb and flowed throughout the day."
*   Economic trends: "The stock market is known for its constant ebb and flow."
*   Natural cycles: "The seasons follow a natural ebb and flow."
*   Social movements: "The popularity of certain trends often ebbs and flows.”

## Interesting concepts
### Humans overestimating (Kahneman concept)
Nuclear energy is the cleanest and safest option. However, some nations are reluctant to consider it given that their public overestimates probabilities of rare events, as humans are wont to. Three-mile islands, Chernobyl and Fukushima, loom large in people's minds. Prof. Daniel Kahneman, who passed away earlier this year, would have chuckled.

Kahneman explains how people tend to overestimate the likelihood of events that are more easily recalled or more dramatic

## Syllabus & Guidance
They will be expected to keep closely to the subject of the essay to arrange their ideas in orderly fashion, and to write concisely. Credit will be given for effective and exact expression.

### Interpretation
*   Avoid vague or ambiguous statements
    *   Instead of: "The weather was bad" (vague)
    *   Exact expression: "The torrential rain flooded the streets" (precise)
*   Using precise, accurate language without wordiness (exact)
*   Main brevity

### Excerpts from Vikram Grewal blog
*   Brevity
    *   By 'brevity' I refer to clear cut and crisp statements that encompass the issues you are writing about.
*   Every paragraph should have a new idea related to the central theme.
*   You will have to add a lot of **wit** in it: nuanced perspectives (role of politico-industrial lobby, eco-feminism etc.) and fascinating references (use Harari's 'Homo Deus' to show the advent Anthropocene; or Al Gore's award winning documentary 'The Inconvenient Truth'; or the recent UN-supported Indian film 'Kadwi Hawa'.)
*   You should know when to stop and pick up a new aspect of the topic.
*   Take 15-Minutes to chalk out **20 points related to the topic**- on the rough page.
*   Drive the essay forward by using keywords. And weave a thread in between paragraphs to stay connected to the main title.
    *   I do not exactly know what this means

### Excerpts from Avadh Singhal's blog
*   Each essay I wrote would generally be around 12-15 pages.
*   I used 1-2 pages for introduction, half page for conclusion and remaining for the body.
*   Intro
    *   Gives an opportunity to show the examiner that you have understood the topic clearly.
    *   Then in the next few paragraphs I used to establish the relevance of the topic in contemporary times based on the recent incidents/data/facts linking them closely to the topic.
*   Body
    *   I started with defining any key terms of the essay which are not obvious.
    *   This becomes all the more important in abstract essays as it acts as an anchor for ambiguous/ broad meaning words and phrases. Even in non-abstract essays if there's a term which requires some specification to remove ambiguity, do specify how you are going to use it. For eg. For the essay topic of Courage to accept and dedication to improve are two keys to success (CSE19), I defined courage to accept as courage to accept failure/mistakes/shortcomings.
    *   Avoid using long and verbose sentences.
    *   Avoid repetition of the same point using different words.

## Writing notes
### Different methods of writings in the essay:
*   Mentioning a 2-5 word title to the paragraph. Example:
    ![[Essay-8.png]]
    *THE PILL: In 1960, US FDA approved the birth control pill, freeing women from the restrictions of child-bearing. Women*
*   Ending the introduction with questions
    [![[Essay-9.png]]
    *When half of the population is more independent & efficient, does it not enhance the potential of our aggregate pie? Does bodily autonomy of women not promote sound generation of youngsters who are wanted and mental & physical health? Such questions help us understand how feminism; if everything it stands for can mutually benefit all in society.*
*   Mentioning what we are going to explore in the following paragraphs - for instance, "Whether such dismal numbers have any far-reaching repercussions on all is explored in the following paragraphs"
*   Writing numbers or anecdotes and then mentioning your take on it. Like what the previous paragraph highlights and then writing solutions proposed by people
    ![[Essay-10.png]]
    *This highlights how women are under utilized, underpaid and overstretched. Amartya Sen has played a pioneering role in paying attention to the "missing women". He emphasises on the capability approach to bring mainstream...*

### Introductions methods
#### General Anecdote guidance
*   The anecdote has to conclude in a manner that shows that you have understood the essay topic
    *   This can be done by repeating the words from the essay question

#### Anecdote → Definition
*   Start with an anecdote, for instance that Sapna one from Climate Change and in the next paragraph mention the definition like done for climate change

#### Anecdote from the past & an anecdote from the present
*   This has been to show that certain things do not change and remain the same. It can be a positive or a negative behaviour/attitude/value/culture etc.
*   But for this to work, they need to follow the same thread or conclusion in the anecdotes
*   Added an example to [Topic (1)](#topic-1-exploration)

#### Definition (after anecdote/quote or otherwise)
*   As it was mentioned by Avadh Singhal, the definitions should be of all the different major terms and not just of one term.

#### Transition from intro to body methods
##### Method for "In the following essay"
*   In broad strokes mention what all will be discussed based on what was brainstormed
*   Example: In the following Essay, we will first look upon what Feminism is, how it talks not just about Equality but full humanity of Women. Then we will look at why equality is so important. We will also see what factors are inhibiting this equality and humanity of Women followed by how to have a Brighter Future.

##### Method one quote
*   Mention "In this essay..."
*   A quote

### Body methods
Note to self:
1.  When brainstorming points for the body, use one of these methods while doing the rough work
2.  Looks like they keep reiterating the same point in the body but in different dimensions like history, economic, political, etc & through different examples in each dimension

#### Describe an instance or example → what did it cause
In the first paragraph define the instance or example like they defined how industrial revolution
*   Industrial revolution → Rise in consumerism

#### Start the paragraph with a question & answer it in the para

#### Frameworks noticed for Body
*   With the topic like "One cannot change the world alone but can caste a stone across water to create many ripples"
    *   Individual → Society → National

#### Sample headers
*   Feminism
    *   "Feminism & Economy: Miles to go before we sleep"

#### Good language/words
*   Sisyphean task
*   It would be a comedy if it were not real and tragic
*   "However, this is only one side of a coin"
*   But even as societies have progressed, the blessings of X (write something instead of X) are elusive for some.
*   Game theory
    *   Zero Sum Game

#### Copies examined
*   Anjali Garg
*   Anoushka Sharma

#### Mental notes on writing (yet to be placed)
*   In each paragraph especially at the end try to mention the key words from the question/quote
*   At the start of a paragraph, mention two dichotomous terms and in the next paragraph mention their meaning. And then mention which of the two has been used (example in screenshot one)

![[Essay-11.png]]
*Screenshot one (TH-06-25)*
*Existing conflict
At the heart of the judgment is the conflict between cultural relativism and universalism. The universalists argue for adoption of human rights standards, whereas the cultural relativists rely on customary laws and practices and religious beliefs. The judge has chosen the relativist argument and has moved away from the norms in international instruments, where the Preamble of the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights mention human dignity. The judge failed to recognise that traditional and religious practices are steeped in superstitious beliefs and are the refuge of the ignorant and fearful, who guard against the challenge to their privileges.*

#### Comparison in an interesting way:
*   WE FULLY APPRECIATE our knees only when they stop working. The same is true of the global order: its former benefits become apparent only as it collapses. And when order collapses, the weak usually suffer most. This law of history should be on the minds of world leaders in the run-up to the Ukraine peace summit in Switzerland on June 15th (from Economist)

# Philosophy Mental Models
## Philosophy:
### Self:
*   **Thought experiments** are imaginary cases in which variables are controlled to reveal intuitions. They are much used in philosophy.
*   **Ship of Theseus**: The ship wherein Theseus and the youth of Athens returned had thirty oars, and was preserved by the Athenians down even to the time of Demetrius Phalereus, for they took away the old planks as they decayed, putting in new and stronger timber in their place, insomuch that this ship became a standing example among the philosophers, for the logical question of things that grow; one side holding that the ship remained the same, and the other contending that it was not the same. (Plutarch)
*   **'personal identity'** is much used by philosophers when discussing what, if anything, makes a person the same person despite changes over time.
*   **Hume**, who is very much within the empiricist tradition of philosophy following on from Locke, believed that the contents of our minds consisted of what he called **ideas and impressions**. In other words, Hume not only rejects the idea that there is a self or soul underlying all our experience, but also acknowledges the temptation of thinking of ourselves in these terms. Hume's search for the self provides a psychological explanation of why we might be seduced into believing that there is some such unchanging self lurking behind everything that we do. He remains, though, adamant that no such self exists. The unchanging self (or soul) is a fiction. In his discussion, like Locke, he gives an important role to memory; but whereas Locke thought that our memory constitutes our personal identity, Hume believed that memory bundles our experiences together and gives us the illusion that they all belong to a continuing self. For this reason, his theory is often described as the **Bundle Theory of the Self**, even though he doesn't believe that the bundle is an enduring self, but rather the source of the illusion that we have a self.
*   **Hume's fork**: Hume outlines his approach to philosophy. Take any bit of argument or reasoning, Hume says, and there are just two options:itmusteitherbetruebydefinition, as is 2 + 3 = 5, or else empirically discoverable (i.e. its truth or falsity can be discovered by some kind of observation). If it is neither, then, he says, it is 'sophistry and illusion' and should be burned.
*   **Empiricism**: Hume, was completely committed to the notion that every simple idea derives from an impression. This is the core of his empiricism. In other words, he did not believe that we could have any innate ideas: we learn from experience.
*   **Realism**: Reality exists absolutely and either by rationalism or empiricism we get to know it (Locke)
*   **Idealism** says reality is dependent on the mind and has no existence outside of it (Berkeley)
*   **Dualism**: Mind and body are two separate things (Descartes)

### Religion:
*   **Monotheism**: One god (Abrahamic religions eg Islam and Christianity)
*   **Polytheism**: The Ancient Greeks, Romans and Vikings all believed in many gods, as do some Hindus today. (Their view is called polytheism, from the Greek polu 'many' and theoi 'gods'.)
*   **Pantheism**: the philosopher Baruch Spinoza said that God was the same thing as everything - the whole of reality. (This view of God is called pantheism, from the Greek pan 'everything' and theos 'God'.)
*   **Atheism**: After all, many people don't believe in God at all. (Their view is called atheism, from the Greek a 'not' and theos 'God'.)
*   **Agnosticism**: And many other people don't think that we can know one way or the other whether or not there is a God. (Their view is called agnosticism, from the Greek a 'not' and gnosis 'knowledge'.)
*   **Fideism**: belief in God doesn't depend on reasons. Belief in God is good for us - it makes our lives go better than they do without belief - so we should believe in God even though we don't have very good evidence that he exists. This is the kind of view that has been suggested by the seventeenth- and nineteenth-century philosophers Blaise Pascal and William James. Their view is often called fideism (from Latin fides, 'faith'). Some people even think that there can't be any real faith in God unless there is no evidence for God's existence. Faith is essentially trust, and there can't be trust unless there is something you don't know:
*   Conversely, you might think that belief in God is bad for us, and conclude that we have good reason not to believe in God, whether or not we have good evidence that he doesn't exist. This is the kind of view that you will find in the writings of Friedrich Nietzsche and the twentieth-century philosopher Bertrand Russell.
*   **ontological argument**: many theists have defended the argument that God's existence is something we can know about just by reflecting on the very idea or concept of God.- arguments that say that it follows from the concept of God that God exists (or doesn't exist). This sort of argument is called the ontological argument, and versions of it can be found in Anselm, Descartes and Leibniz, as well as in the work of some modern philosophers.
*   **Argument from design**: The detail of the world's design shows that there is a God. This is the classic argument from design. It is sometimes also called the argument for design, or teleological argument (from 'teleology', the study of design or purpose in nature).
*   **cosmological argument** - 'How can there be a creation unless there was a creator?' This argument is what philosophers sometimes call the cosmological argument (from 'cosmology', the study of the origins of the universe).
*   **Argument**: Often in philosophy, it helps to write an argument out as a set of claims which we call **premises**, leading to another claim which we call the **conclusion**.
    *   2 traits that all arguments ought to have. The first is that all its premises are true (if you ignore the fact that they are expressed in the present tense even though Socrates died long ago). The second is that the inference from its premises to its conclusions is a good one – or, as philosophers like to put it, the inference is valid. To say that an inference is **valid** is to say that it is guaranteed to be truth-preserving: if the premises of a valid inference are true, then this truth is bound to carry over to the conclusion.
    *   i.e. all its premises are true and it is valid - then the argument is said to be **sound**. If it fails on either count - i.e. if it has one or more false premises, or if it contains an invalid inference - then it is unsound.
*   **Problem of evil**: 'If a perfectly good God designed the world, why didn't he design a perfectly good world?' But the problem goes wider than that. It is a problem for anyone who believes in a God who, like the Christian or Muslim or Jewish God, is both perfectly good and perfectly powerful (omnipotent).
*   **Miracles**: the laws of nature are those scientific principles which we believe in because our experience always supports them. a miracle is a violation of a law of nature, this means that all our experience contradicts it. (Hume). To believe in miracles at all is necessarily to believe that God acts in a mysteriously selective way (why do miracles for some and not the others)

### Ethics:
*   A moral theory is a set of general principles (what Sartre refers to as 'rules of general morality' in the quotation above) that purport to tell us how we should behave and why. (eg utilitarianism and kantianism)
*   Morality can be dependent on
    *   **Social norms** (eg slavery was acceptable in ancient greece and rome)
    *   **Biology**: Some think that the moral views we espouse are no more than the product of our animal drives. A traditional version of this outlook sees morality as growing out of our emotional dispositions, conceived of as belonging to our animal side rather than our rational side.A modern version of the outlook treats our inclination to act and think in moral terms as no more than the result of the reproductive advantage this same inclination provided to our evolutionary ancestors.
    *   **Religion**: many think that moral judgements depend for their plausibility on the assumption that they are in some sense the word of God.
*   **Virtue**: A virtue, in the sense prevalent in fourth century BC Athens, is a character trait that promotes well-being in those who possess it. In later Catholic theology, there were seven virtues. These combined the four 'cardinal' virtues settled on by Plato in his Republic with faith, hope and charity, the three 'theological' virtues.
*   **Ring of Gyges**: In Republic, a famous speech by Glaucon in which he challenges Socrates to defend the thought that justice is a genuine virtue (in the ancient sense of promoting well-being in its possessor). Glaucon suggests that we never have reason to act justly as such; rather, we have at most reason to appear just to others, acting unjustly whenever we can get away with it. Glaucon, suggests that the proper reaction to the question 'Why be moral?' is to acknowledge that there is no reason aside from fear of punishment. Socrates argues that justice is a virtue for well being. show it by arguing that philosophers - his label for those whose minds come closest to being mentally harmonious, their lives ruled by their rational part - are happier than anyone else.pleasure associated with being ruled by the rational part of one's mind, in other words the pleasure of being a philosopher in Socrates' special sense of this word, is more rewarding than the pleasure associated with avarice (being ruled by one's appetites) or ambition (being ruled by one's passionate part).
*   **Utilitarianism**
    *   Bentham's utilitarianism has two elements.
        *   Its first element is the claim that we are morally obliged to do whatever is likely to produce the best overall consequences. This claim has come to be known as **consequentialism**. Consequentialists can disagree over what makes one set of consequences better than another. For example, an evangelical consequentialist (if there is such a thing) will say that we should do whatever saves the most souls from eternal damnation, and set about spreading the word of God as a means to this end. An economic consequentialist (these definitely exist) will say that we should do whatever produces the greatest overall wealth in the economy. Bentham is a hedonistic consequentialist.
        *   **Hedonism** (in the philosophical sense) is the view that one situation is better than another if it contains more overall happiness, where happiness is understood as the total amount of pleasure minus the total amount of pain.
    *   Mill's **qualitative hedonism** differs from Bentham's quantitative hedonism in that he thinks some experiences are preferable to others not only in the amount of pleasure or pain they give rise to (after taking intensity, duration, etc. into account) but also in the type.
    *   Mill calls the pleasures that derive from the exercise of the higher faculties (meaning, in particular, the intellect) **higher pleasures**, while those associated with the animalesque lower faculties he calls lower pleasures. Mill holds, then, that the higher pleasures are qualitatively different from and superior in value to the lower pleasures.
    *   **Act utilitarianism** We should act so as to bring about the greatest possible happiness. Bentham
    *   **Rule utilitarianism** We should act in accordance with the best set of rules, i.e. the set that would, if adopted, lead to the greatest possible happiness. Mill.
    *   **Golden rule**: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you'
*   **Kantian rules**:
    *   Our reasons for acting must be universalizable. I Can't Make arbitrary exceptions for myself, my friends and my family.
    *   2 Striving to do the right thing because it is the right thing has moral worth even if your efforts get you nowhere.
    *   3 An act has no moral worth if it is done solely to experience the warm glow that often attends knowingly doing the right thing.
    *   4 It is wrong to treat others merely as a means to an end – they must always also be treated as an end in themselves.
*
